Text.create(title: 'A Bird Came Down The Walk', words: 115, characters: 566,
content: 'A Bird, came down the Walk -
He did not know I saw -
He bit an Angle Worm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw,

And then, he drank a Dew
From a convenient Grass -
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass -

He glanced with rapid eyes,
That hurried all abroad -
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought,
He stirred his Velvet Head. -

Like one in danger, Cautious,
I offered him a Crumb,
And he unrolled his feathers,
And rowed him softer Home -

Than Oars divide the Ocean,
Too silver for a seam,
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,
Leap, plashless as they swim.', author_id: 1)

But could It teach it?
Easiest of Arts, they say
When one learn how

Dull Hearts have died
In the Acquisition
Sacrificed for Science

I went to School
But was not wiser
Globe did not teach it
Nor Logarithm Show

How to forget!
Say — some — Philosopher!
Ah, to be erudite
Enough to know!

Is it in a Book?
So, I could buy it —
Is it like a Planet?
Telescopes would know —

If it be invention
It must have a Patent.

My Mind was going numb –

And creak across my Soul

Then Space – began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,

Wrecked, solitary, here –

And I dropped down, and down –
And hit a World, at every plunge,
