 CHAPTER 1. Amory, Son of Beatrice
 
 Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the
 stray inexpressible few, that made him worthwhile. His father,
 an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a
 habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy
 at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful
 Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world
 was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O’Hara. In
 consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height
 of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at crucial
 moments, these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory. For
 many years he hovered in the background of his family’s life, an
 unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless,
 silky hair, continually occupied in “taking care” of his wife,
 continually harassed by the idea that he didn’t and couldn’t
 understand her.
 
 But Beatrice Blaine! There was a woman! Early pictures taken on
 her father’s estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the
 Sacred Heart Convent—an educational extravagance that in her
 youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally
 wealthy—showed the exquisite delicacy of her features, the
 consummate art and simplicity of her clothes. A brilliant
 education she had—her youth passed in renaissance glory, she was
 versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families; known by
 name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and
 Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have
 had some culture even to have heard of. She learned in England to
 prefer whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened
 in two senses during a winter in Vienna. All in all Beatrice
 O’Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite
 impossible ever again; a tutelage measured by the number of
 things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming
 about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of all
 ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped
 the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud.
 
 In her less important moments she returned to America, met
 Stephen Blaine and married him—this almost entirely because she
 was a little bit weary, a little bit sad. Her only child was
 carried through a tiresome season and brought into the world on a
 spring day in ninety-six.
 
 When Amory was five he was already a delightful companion for
 her. He was an auburn-haired boy, with great, handsome eyes which
 he would grow up to in time, a facile imaginative mind and a
 taste for fancy dress. From his fourth to his tenth year he did
 the country with his mother in her father’s private car, from
 Coronado, where his mother became so bored that she had a nervous
 breakdown in a fashionable hotel, down to Mexico City, where she
 took a mild, almost epidemic consumption. This trouble pleased
 her, and later she made use of it as an intrinsic part of her
 atmosphere—especially after several astounding bracers.
 
 So, while more or less fortunate little rich boys were defying
 governesses on the beach at Newport, or being spanked or tutored
 or read to from “Do and Dare,” or “Frank on the Mississippi,”
 Amory was biting acquiescent bell-boys in the Waldorf, outgrowing
 a natural repugnance to chamber music and symphonies, and
 deriving a highly specialized education from his mother.
 
 “Amory.”
 
 “Yes, Beatrice.” (Such a quaint name for his mother; she
 encouraged it.)
 
 “Dear, don’t _think_ of getting out of bed yet. I’ve always
 suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous.
 Clothilde is having your breakfast brought up.”
 
 “All right.”
 
 “I am feeling very old to-day, Amory,” she would sigh, her face a
 rare cameo of pathos, her voice exquisitely modulated, her hands
 as facile as Bernhardt’s. “My nerves are on edge—on edge. We must
 leave this terrifying place to-morrow and go searching for
 sunshine.”
 
 Amory’s penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled
 hair at his mother. Even at this age he had no illusions about
 her.
 
 “Amory.”
 
 “Oh, _yes_.”
 
 “I want you to take a red-hot bath as hot as you can bear it, and
 just relax your nerves. You can read in the tub if you wish.”
 
 She fed him sections of the “Fetes Galantes” before he was ten;
 at eleven he could talk glibly, if rather reminiscently, of
 Brahms and Mozart and Beethoven. One afternoon, when left alone
 in the hotel at Hot Springs, he sampled his mother’s apricot
 cordial, and as the taste pleased him, he became quite tipsy.
 This was fun for a while, but he essayed a cigarette in his
 exaltation, and succumbed to a vulgar, plebeian reaction. Though
 this incident horrified Beatrice, it also secretly amused her and
 became part of what in a later generation would have been termed
 her “line.”
 
 “This son of mine,” he heard her tell a room full of awestruck,
 admiring women one day, “is entirely sophisticated and quite
 charming—but delicate—we’re all delicate; _here_, you know.” Her
 hand was radiantly outlined against her beautiful bosom; then
 sinking her voice to a whisper, she told them of the apricot
 cordial. They rejoiced, for she was a brave raconteuse, but many
 were the keys turned in sideboard locks that night against the
 possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara....
 
 These domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state; two maids,
 the private car, or Mr. Blaine when available, and very often a
 physician. When Amory had the whooping-cough four disgusted
 specialists glared at each other hunched around his bed; when he
 took scarlet fever the number of attendants, including physicians
 and nurses, totalled fourteen. However, blood being thicker than
 broth, he was pulled through.
 
 The Blaines were attached to no city. They were the Blaines of
 Lake Geneva; they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of
 friends, and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod. But
 Beatrice grew more and more prone to like only new acquaintances,
 as there were certain stories, such as the history of her
 constitution and its many amendments, memories of her years
 abroad, that it was necessary for her to repeat at regular
 intervals. Like Freudian dreams, they must be thrown off, else
 they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves. But Beatrice was
 critical about American women, especially the floating population
 of ex-Westerners.
 
 “They have accents, my dear,” she told Amory, “not Southern
 accents or Boston accents, not an accent attached to any
 locality, just an accent”—she became dreamy. “They pick up old,
 moth-eaten London accents that are down on their luck and have to
 be used by some one. They talk as an English butler might after
 several years in a Chicago grand-opera company.” She became
 almost incoherent—“Suppose—time in every Western woman’s life—she
 feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to
 have—accent—they try to impress _me_, my dear—”
 
 Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties, she
 considered her soul quite as ill, and therefore important in her
 life. She had once been a Catholic, but discovering that priests
 were infinitely more attentive when she was in process of losing
 or regaining faith in Mother Church, she maintained an
 enchantingly wavering attitude. Often she deplored the bourgeois
 quality of the American Catholic clergy, and was quite sure that
 had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental cathedrals
 her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of Rome.
 Still, next to doctors, priests were her favorite sport.
 
 “Ah, Bishop Wiston,” she would declare, “I do not want to talk of
 myself. I can imagine the stream of hysterical women fluttering
 at your doors, beseeching you to be simpatico”—then after an
 interlude filled by the clergyman—“but my mood—is—oddly
 dissimilar.”
 
 Only to bishops and above did she divulge her clerical romance.
 When she had first returned to her country there had been a
 pagan, Swinburnian young man in Asheville, for whose passionate
 kisses and unsentimental conversations she had taken a decided
 penchant—they had discussed the matter pro and con with an
 intellectual romancing quite devoid of sappiness. Eventually she
 had decided to marry for background, and the young pagan from
 Asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis, joined the
 Catholic Church, and was now—Monsignor Darcy.
 
 “Indeed, Mrs. Blaine, he is still delightful company—quite the
 cardinal’s right-hand man.”
 
 “Amory will go to him one day, I know,” breathed the beautiful
 lady, “and Monsignor Darcy will understand him as he understood
 me.”
 
 Amory became thirteen, rather tall and slender, and more than
 ever on to his Celtic mother. He had tutored occasionally—the
 idea being that he was to “keep up,” at each place “taking up the
 work where he left off,” yet as no tutor ever found the place he
 left off, his mind was still in very good shape. What a few more
 years of this life would have made of him is problematical.
 However, four hours out from land, Italy bound, with Beatrice,
 his appendix burst, probably from too many meals in bed, and
 after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America, to the
 amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around
 and returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier. You will
 admit that if it was not life it was magnificent.
 
 After the operation Beatrice had a nervous breakdown that bore a
 suspicious resemblance to delirium tremens, and Amory was left in
 Minneapolis, destined to spend the ensuing two years with his
 aunt and uncle. There the crude, vulgar air of Western
 civilization first catches him—in his underwear, so to speak.
 
 A KISS FOR AMORY
 
 His lip curled when he read it.
 
   “I am going to have a bobbing party,” it said, “on Thursday, December
   the seventeenth, at five o’clock, and I would like it very much if
   you could come.
 Yours truly,
   R.S.V.P. Myra St. Claire.
 
 He had been two months in Minneapolis, and his chief struggle had
 been the concealing from “the other guys at school” how
 particularly superior he felt himself to be, yet this conviction
 was built upon shifting sands. He had shown off one day in French
 class (he was in senior French class) to the utter confusion of
 Mr. Reardon, whose accent Amory damned contemptuously, and to the
 delight of the class. Mr. Reardon, who had spent several weeks in
 Paris ten years before, took his revenge on the verbs, whenever
 he had his book open. But another time Amory showed off in
 history class, with quite disastrous results, for the boys there
 were his own age, and they shrilled innuendoes at each other all
 the following week:
 
 “Aw—I b’lieve, doncherknow, the Umuricun revolution was _lawgely_
 an affair of the middul _clawses_,” or
 
 “Washington came of very good blood—aw, quite good—I b’lieve.”
 
 Amory ingeniously tried to retrieve himself by blundering on
 purpose. Two years before he had commenced a history of the
 United States which, though it only got as far as the Colonial
 Wars, had been pronounced by his mother completely enchanting.
 
 His chief disadvantage lay in athletics, but as soon as he
 discovered that it was the touchstone of power and popularity at
 school, he began to make furious, persistent efforts to excel in
 the winter sports, and with his ankles aching and bending in
 spite of his efforts, he skated valiantly around the Lorelie rink
 every afternoon, wondering how soon he would be able to carry a
 hockey-stick without getting it inexplicably tangled in his
 skates.
 
 The invitation to Miss Myra St. Claire’s bobbing party spent the
 morning in his coat pocket, where it had an intense physical
 affair with a dusty piece of peanut brittle. During the afternoon
 he brought it to light with a sigh, and after some consideration
 and a preliminary draft in the back of Collar and Daniel’s
 “First-Year Latin,” composed an answer:
 
 My dear Miss St. Claire: Your truly charming invitation for the
 evening of next Thursday evening was truly delightful to receive this
 morning.  I will be charm and enchanted indeed to present my
 compliments on next Thursday evening. Faithfully,
 Amory Blaine.
 
 
 On Thursday, therefore, he walked pensively along the slippery,
 shovel-scraped sidewalks, and came in sight of Myra’s house, on
 the half-hour after five, a lateness which he fancied his mother
 would have favored. He waited on the door-step with his eyes
 nonchalantly half-closed, and planned his entrance with
 precision. He would cross the floor, not too hastily, to Mrs. St.
 Claire, and say with exactly the correct modulation:
 
 “My _dear_ Mrs. St. Claire, I’m _frightfully_ sorry to be late,
 but my maid”—he paused there and realized he would be
 quoting—“but my uncle and I had to see a fella—Yes, I’ve met your
 enchanting daughter at dancing-school.”
 
 Then he would shake hands, using that slight, half-foreign bow,
 with all the starchy little females, and nod to the fellas who
 would be standing ’round, paralyzed into rigid groups for mutual
 protection.
 
 A butler (one of the three in Minneapolis) swung open the door.
 Amory stepped inside and divested himself of cap and coat. He was
 mildly surprised not to hear the shrill squawk of conversation
 from the next room, and he decided it must be quite formal. He
 approved of that—as he approved of the butler.
 
 “Miss Myra,” he said.
 
 To his surprise the butler grinned horribly.
 
 “Oh, yeah,” he declared, “she’s here.” He was unaware that his
 failure to be cockney was ruining his standing. Amory considered
 him coldly.
 
 “But,” continued the butler, his voice rising unnecessarily,
 “she’s the only one what _is_ here. The party’s gone.”
 
 Amory gasped in sudden horror.
 
 “What?”
 
 “She’s been waitin’ for Amory Blaine. That’s you, ain’t it? Her
 mother says that if you showed up by five-thirty you two was to
 go after ’em in the Packard.”
 
 Amory’s despair was crystallized by the appearance of Myra
 herself, bundled to the ears in a polo coat, her face plainly
 sulky, her voice pleasant only with difficulty.
 
 “’Lo, Amory.”
 
 “’Lo, Myra.” He had described the state of his vitality.
 
 “Well—you _got_ here, _anyway.”
 
 “Well—I’ll tell you. I guess you don’t know about the auto
 accident,” he romanced.
 
 Myra’s eyes opened wide.
 
 “Who was it to?”
 
 “Well,” he continued desperately, “uncle ’n aunt ’n I.”
 
 “Was any one _killed?_”
 
 Amory paused and then nodded.
 
 “Your uncle?”—alarm.
 
 “Oh, no just a horse—a sorta gray horse.”
 
 At this point the Erse butler snickered.
 
 “Probably killed the engine,” he suggested. Amory would have put
 him on the rack without a scruple.
 
 “We’ll go now,” said Myra coolly. “You see, Amory, the bobs were
 ordered for five and everybody was here, so we couldn’t wait—”
 
 “Well, I couldn’t help it, could I?”
 
 “So mama said for me to wait till ha’past five. We’ll catch the
 bobs before it gets to the Minnehaha Club, Amory.”
 
 Amory’s shredded poise dropped from him. He pictured the happy
 party jingling along snowy streets, the appearance of the
 limousine, the horrible public descent of him and Myra before
 sixty reproachful eyes, his apology—a real one this time. He
 sighed aloud.
 
 “What?” inquired Myra.
 
 “Nothing. I was just yawning. Are we going to _surely_ catch up
 with ’em before they get there?” He was encouraging a faint hope
 that they might slip into the Minnehaha Club and meet the others
 there, be found in blasé seclusion before the fire and quite
 regain his lost attitude.
 
 “Oh, sure Mike, we’ll catch ’em all right—let’s hurry.”
 
 He became conscious of his stomach. As they stepped into the
 machine he hurriedly slapped the paint of diplomacy over a rather
 box-like plan he had conceived. It was based upon some
 “trade-lasts” gleaned at dancing-school, to the effect that he
 was “awful good-looking and _English_, sort of.”
 
 “Myra,” he said, lowering his voice and choosing his words
 carefully, “I beg a thousand pardons. Can you ever forgive me?”
 She regarded him gravely, his intent green eyes, his mouth, that
 to her thirteen-year-old, arrow-collar taste was the quintessence
 of romance. Yes, Myra could forgive him very easily.
 
 “Why—yes—sure.”
 
 He looked at her again, and then dropped his eyes. He had lashes.
 
 “I’m awful,” he said sadly. “I’m diff’runt. I don’t know why I
 make faux pas. ’Cause I don’t care, I s’pose.” Then, recklessly:
 “I been smoking too much. I’ve got t’bacca heart.”
 
 Myra pictured an all-night tobacco debauch, with Amory pale and
 reeling from the effect of nicotined lungs. She gave a little
 gasp.
 
 “Oh, _Amory_, don’t smoke. You’ll stunt your _growth!_”
 
 “I don’t care,” he persisted gloomily. “I gotta. I got the habit.
 I’ve done a lot of things that if my fambly knew”—he hesitated,
 giving her imagination time to picture dark horrors—“I went to
 the burlesque show last week.”
 
 Myra was quite overcome. He turned the green eyes on her again.
 “You’re the only girl in town I like much,” he exclaimed in a
 rush of sentiment. “You’re simpatico.”
 
 Myra was not sure that she was, but it sounded stylish though
 vaguely improper.
 
 Thick dusk had descended outside, and as the limousine made a
 sudden turn she was jolted against him; their hands touched.
 
 “You shouldn’t smoke, Amory,” she whispered. “Don’t you know
 that?”
 
 He shook his head.
 
 “Nobody cares.”
 
 Myra hesitated.
 
 “_I_ care.”
 
 Something stirred within Amory.
 
 “Oh, yes, you do! You got a crush on Froggy Parker. I guess
 everybody knows that.”
 
 “No, I haven’t,” very slowly.
 
 A silence, while Amory thrilled. There was something fascinating
 about Myra, shut away here cosily from the dim, chill air. Myra,
 a little bundle of clothes, with strands of yellow hair curling
 out from under her skating cap.
 
 “Because I’ve got a crush, too—” He paused, for he heard in the
 distance the sound of young laughter, and, peering through the
 frosted glass along the lamp-lit street, he made out the dark
 outline of the bobbing party. He must act quickly. He reached
 over with a violent, jerky effort, and clutched Myra’s hand—her
 thumb, to be exact.
 
 “Tell him to go to the Minnehaha straight,” he whispered. “I
 wanta talk to you—I _got_ to talk to you.”
 
 Myra made out the party ahead, had an instant vision of her
 mother, and then—alas for convention—glanced into the eyes
 beside. “Turn down this side street, Richard, and drive straight
 to the Minnehaha Club!” she cried through the speaking tube.
 Amory sank back against the cushions with a sigh of relief.
 
 “I can kiss her,” he thought. “I’ll bet I can. I’ll _bet_ I can!”
 
 Overhead the sky was half crystalline, half misty, and the night
 around was chill and vibrant with rich tension. From the Country
 Club steps the roads stretched away, dark creases on the white
 blanket; huge heaps of snow lining the sides like the tracks of
 giant moles. They lingered for a moment on the steps, and watched
 the white holiday moon.
 
 “Pale moons like that one”—Amory made a vague gesture—“make
 people mysterieuse. You look like a young witch with her cap off
 and her hair sorta mussed”—her hands clutched at her hair—“Oh,
 leave it, it looks _good_.”
 
 They drifted up the stairs and Myra led the way into the little
 den of his dreams, where a cosy fire was burning before a big
 sink-down couch. A few years later this was to be a great stage
 for Amory, a cradle for many an emotional crisis. Now they talked
 for a moment about bobbing parties.
 
 “There’s always a bunch of shy fellas,” he commented, “sitting at
 the tail of the bob, sorta lurkin’ an’ whisperin’ an’ pushin’
 each other off. Then there’s always some crazy cross-eyed
 girl”—he gave a terrifying imitation—“she’s always talkin’
 _hard_, sorta, to the chaperon.”
 
 “You’re such a funny boy,” puzzled Myra.
 
 “How d’y’ mean?” Amory gave immediate attention, on his own
 ground at last.
 
 “Oh—always talking about crazy things. Why don’t you come ski-ing
 with Marylyn and I to-morrow?”
 
 “I don’t like girls in the daytime,” he said shortly, and then,
 thinking this a bit abrupt, he added: “But I like you.” He
 cleared his throat. “I like you first and second and third.”
 
 Myra’s eyes became dreamy. What a story this would make to tell
 Marylyn! Here on the couch with this _wonderful_-looking boy—the
 little fire—the sense that they were alone in the great building—
 
 Myra capitulated. The atmosphere was too appropriate.
 
 “I like you the first twenty-five,” she confessed, her voice
 trembling, “and Froggy Parker twenty-sixth.”
 
 Froggy had fallen twenty-five places in one hour. As yet he had
 not even noticed it.
 
 But Amory, being on the spot, leaned over quickly and kissed
 Myra’s cheek. He had never kissed a girl before, and he tasted
 his lips curiously, as if he had munched some new fruit. Then
 their lips brushed like young wild flowers in the wind.
 
 “We’re awful,” rejoiced Myra gently. She slipped her hand into
 his, her head drooped against his shoulder. Sudden revulsion
 seized Amory, disgust, loathing for the whole incident. He
 desired frantically to be away, never to see Myra again, never to
 kiss any one; he became conscious of his face and hers, of their
 clinging hands, and he wanted to creep out of his body and hide
 somewhere safe out of sight, up in the corner of his mind.
 
 “Kiss me again.” Her voice came out of a great void.
 
 “I don’t want to,” he heard himself saying. There was another
 pause.
 
 “I don’t want to!” he repeated passionately.
 
 Myra sprang up, her cheeks pink with bruised vanity, the great
 bow on the back of her head trembling sympathetically.
 
 “I hate you!” she cried. “Don’t you ever dare to speak to me
 again!”
 
 “What?” stammered Amory.
 
 “I’ll tell mama you kissed me! I will too! I will too! I’ll tell
 mama, and she won’t let me play with you!”
 
 Amory rose and stared at her helplessly, as though she were a new
 animal of whose presence on the earth he had not heretofore been
 aware.
 
 The door opened suddenly, and Myra’s mother appeared on the
 threshold, fumbling with her lorgnette.
 
 “Well,” she began, adjusting it benignantly, “the man at the desk
 told me you two children were up here—How do you do, Amory.”
 
 Amory watched Myra and waited for the crash—but none came. The
 pout faded, the high pink subsided, and Myra’s voice was placid
 as a summer lake when she answered her mother.
 
 “Oh, we started so late, mama, that I thought we might as well—”
 
 He heard from below the shrieks of laughter, and smelled the
 vapid odor of hot chocolate and tea-cakes as he silently followed
 mother and daughter down-stairs. The sound of the graphophone
 mingled with the voices of many girls humming the air, and a
 faint glow was born and spread over him:
 
    “Casey-Jones—mounted to the cab-un Casey-Jones—’th his orders in his
    hand. Casey-Jones—mounted to the cab-un Took his farewell journey to
    the prom-ised land.”
 
 
 SNAPSHOTS OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST
 
 Amory spent nearly two years in Minneapolis. The first winter he
 wore moccasins that were born yellow, but after many applications
 of oil and dirt assumed their mature color, a dirty, greenish
 brown; he wore a gray plaid mackinaw coat, and a red toboggan
 cap. His dog, Count Del Monte, ate the red cap, so his uncle gave
 him a gray one that pulled down over his face. The trouble with
 this one was that you breathed into it and your breath froze; one
 day the darn thing froze his cheek. He rubbed snow on his cheek,
 but it turned bluish-black just the same.
 
 
 The Count Del Monte ate a box of bluing once, but it didn’t hurt
 him. Later, however, he lost his mind and ran madly up the
 street, bumping into fences, rolling in gutters, and pursuing his
 eccentric course out of Amory’s life. Amory cried on his bed.
 
 “Poor little Count,” he cried. “Oh, _poor_ little _Count!_”
 
 After several months he suspected Count of a fine piece of
 emotional acting.
 
 Amory and Frog Parker considered that the greatest line in
 literature occurred in Act III of “Arsene Lupin.”
 
 They sat in the first row at the Wednesday and Saturday matinees.
 The line was:
 
 “If one can’t be a great artist or a great soldier, the next best
 thing is to be a great criminal.”
 
 
 Amory fell in love again, and wrote a poem. This was it:
 
 “Marylyn and Sallee, Those are the girls for me. Marylyn stands
 above Sallee in that sweet, deep love.”
 
 He was interested in whether McGovern of Minnesota would make the
 first or second All-American, how to do the card-pass, how to do
 the coin-pass, chameleon ties, how babies were born, and whether
 Three-fingered Brown was really a better pitcher than Christie
 Mathewson.
 
 Among other things he read: “For the Honor of the School,”
 “Little Women” (twice), “The Common Law,” “Sapho,” “Dangerous Dan
 McGrew,” “The Broad Highway” (three times), “The Fall of the
 House of Usher,” “Three Weeks,” “Mary Ware, the Little Colonel’s
 Chum,” “Gunga Din,” The Police Gazette, and Jim-Jam Jems.
 
 He had all the Henty biasses in history, and was particularly
 fond of the cheerful murder stories of Mary Roberts Rinehart.
 
 
 School ruined his French and gave him a distaste for standard
 authors. His masters considered him idle, unreliable and
 superficially clever.
 
 
 He collected locks of hair from many girls. He wore the rings of
 several. Finally, he could borrow no more rings, owing to his
 nervous habit of chewing them out of shape. This, it seemed,
 usually aroused the jealous suspicions of the next borrower.
 
 
 All through the summer months Amory and Frog Parker went each
 week to the Stock Company. Afterward they would stroll home in
 the balmy air of August night, dreaming along Hennepin and
 Nicollet Avenues, through the gay crowd. Amory wondered how
 people could fail to notice that he was a boy marked for glory,
 and when faces of the throng turned toward him and ambiguous eyes
 stared into his, he assumed the most romantic of expressions and
 walked on the air cushions that lie on the asphalts of fourteen.
 
 Always, after he was in bed, there were voices—indefinite,
 fading, enchanting—just outside his window, and before he fell
 asleep he would dream one of his favorite waking dreams, the one
 about becoming a great half-back, or the one about the Japanese
 invasion, when he was rewarded by being made the youngest general
 in the world. It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the
 being. This, too, was quite characteristic of Amory.
 
 
 CODE OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST
 
 Before he was summoned back to Lake Geneva, he had appeared, shy
 but inwardly glowing, in his first long trousers, set off by a
 purple accordion tie and a “Belmont” collar with the edges
 unassailably meeting, purple socks, and handkerchief with a
 purple border peeping from his breast pocket. But more than that,
 he had formulated his first philosophy, a code to live by, which,
 as near as it can be named, was a sort of aristocratic egotism.
 
 He had realized that his best interests were bound up with those
 of a certain variant, changing person, whose label, in order that
 his past might always be identified with him, was Amory Blaine.
 Amory marked himself a fortunate youth, capable of infinite
 expansion for good or evil. He did not consider himself a “strong
 char’c’ter,” but relied on his facility (learn things sorta
 quick) and his superior mentality (read a lotta deep books). He
 was proud of the fact that he could never become a mechanical or
 scientific genius. From no other heights was he debarred.
 
 Physically.—Amory thought that he was exceedingly handsome. He
 was. He fancied himself an athlete of possibilities and a supple
 dancer.
 
 Socially.—Here his condition was, perhaps, most dangerous. He
 granted himself personality, charm, magnetism, poise, the power
 of dominating all contemporary males, the gift of fascinating all
 women.
 
 Mentally.—Complete, unquestioned superiority.
 
 Now a confession will have to be made. Amory had rather a Puritan
 conscience. Not that he yielded to it—later in life he almost
 completely slew it—but at fifteen it made him consider himself a
 great deal worse than other boys... unscrupulousness... the
 desire to influence people in almost every way, even for evil...
 a certain coldness and lack of affection, amounting sometimes to
 cruelty... a shifting sense of honor... an unholy selfishness...
 a puzzled, furtive interest in everything concerning sex.
 
 There was, also, a curious strain of weakness running crosswise
 through his make-up... a harsh phrase from the lips of an older
 boy (older boys usually detested him) was liable to sweep him off
 his poise into surly sensitiveness, or timid stupidity... he was
 a slave to his own moods and he felt that though he was capable
 of recklessness and audacity, he possessed neither courage,
 perseverance, nor self-respect.
 
 Vanity, tempered with self-suspicion if not self-knowledge, a
 sense of people as automatons to his will, a desire to “pass” as
 many boys as possible and get to a vague top of the world... with
 this background did Amory drift into adolescence.
 
 
 PREPARATORY TO THE GREAT ADVENTURE
 
 The train slowed up with midsummer languor at Lake Geneva, and
 Amory caught sight of his mother waiting in her electric on the
 gravelled station drive. It was an ancient electric, one of the
 early types, and painted gray. The sight of her sitting there,
 slenderly erect, and of her face, where beauty and dignity
 combined, melting to a dreamy recollected smile, filled him with
 a sudden great pride of her. As they kissed coolly and he stepped
 into the electric, he felt a quick fear lest he had lost the
 requisite charm to measure up to her.
 
 “Dear boy—you’re _so_ tall... look behind and see if there’s
 anything coming...”
 
 She looked left and right, she slipped cautiously into a speed of
 two miles an hour, beseeching Amory to act as sentinel; and at
 one busy crossing she made him get out and run ahead to signal
 her forward like a traffic policeman. Beatrice was what might be
 termed a careful driver.
 
 “You _are_ tall—but you’re still very handsome—you’ve skipped the
 awkward age, or is that sixteen; perhaps it’s fourteen or
 fifteen; I can never remember; but you’ve skipped it.”
 
 “Don’t embarrass me,” murmured Amory.
 
 “But, my dear boy, what odd clothes! They look as if they were a
 _set_—don’t they? Is your underwear purple, too?”
 
 Amory grunted impolitely.
 
 “You must go to Brooks’ and get some really nice suits. Oh, we’ll
 have a talk to-night or perhaps to-morrow night. I want to tell
 you about your heart—you’ve probably been neglecting your
 heart—and you don’t _know_.”
 
 Amory thought how superficial was the recent overlay of his own
 generation. Aside from a minute shyness, he felt that the old
 cynical kinship with his mother had not been one bit broken. Yet
 for the first few days he wandered about the gardens and along
 the shore in a state of superloneliness, finding a lethargic
 content in smoking “Bull” at the garage with one of the
 chauffeurs.
 
 The sixty acres of the estate were dotted with old and new summer
 houses and many fountains and white benches that came suddenly
 into sight from foliage-hung hiding-places; there was a great and
 constantly increasing family of white cats that prowled the many
 flower-beds and were silhouetted suddenly at night against the
 darkening trees. It was on one of the shadowy paths that Beatrice
 at last captured Amory, after Mr. Blaine had, as usual, retired
 for the evening to his private library. After reproving him for
 avoiding her, she took him for a long tete-a-tete in the
 moonlight. He could not reconcile himself to her beauty, that was
 mother to his own, the exquisite neck and shoulders, the grace of
 a fortunate woman of thirty.
 
 “Amory, dear,” she crooned softly, “I had such a strange, weird
 time after I left you.”
 
 “Did you, Beatrice?”
 
 “When I had my last breakdown”—she spoke of it as a sturdy,
 gallant feat.
 
 “The doctors told me”—her voice sang on a confidential note—“that
 if any man alive had done the consistent drinking that I have, he
 would have been physically _shattered_, my dear, and in his
 _grave_—long in his grave.”
 
 Amory winced, and wondered how this would have sounded to Froggy
 Parker.
 
 “Yes,” continued Beatrice tragically, “I had dreams—wonderful
 visions.” She pressed the palms of her hands into her eyes. “I
 saw bronze rivers lapping marble shores, and great birds that
 soared through the air, parti-colored birds with iridescent
 plumage. I heard strange music and the flare of barbaric
 trumpets—what?”
 
 Amory had snickered.
 
 “What, Amory?”
 
 “I said go on, Beatrice.”
 
 “That was all—it merely recurred and recurred—gardens that
 flaunted coloring against which this would be quite dull, moons
 that whirled and swayed, paler than winter moons, more golden
 than harvest moons—”
 
 “Are you quite well now, Beatrice?”
 
 “Quite well—as well as I will ever be. I am not understood,
 Amory. I know that can’t express it to you, Amory, but—I am not
 understood.”
 
 Amory was quite moved. He put his arm around his mother, rubbing
 his head gently against her shoulder.
 
 “Poor Beatrice—poor Beatrice.”
 
 “Tell me about _you_, Amory. Did you have two _horrible_ years?”
 
 Amory considered lying, and then decided against it.
 
 “No, Beatrice. I enjoyed them. I adapted myself to the
 bourgeoisie. I became conventional.” He surprised himself by
 saying that, and he pictured how Froggy would have gaped.
 
 “Beatrice,” he said suddenly, “I want to go away to school.
 Everybody in Minneapolis is going to go away to school.”
 
 Beatrice showed some alarm.
 
 “But you’re only fifteen.”
 
 “Yes, but everybody goes away to school at fifteen, and I _want_
 to, Beatrice.”
 
 On Beatrice’s suggestion the subject was dropped for the rest of
 the walk, but a week later she delighted him by saying:
 
 “Amory, I have decided to let you have your way. If you still
 want to, you can go to school.”
 
 “Yes?”
 
 “To St. Regis’s in Connecticut.”
 
 Amory felt a quick excitement.
 
 “It’s being arranged,” continued Beatrice. “It’s better that you
 should go away. I’d have preferred you to have gone to Eton, and
 then to Christ Church, Oxford, but it seems impracticable now—and
 for the present we’ll let the university question take care of
 itself.”
 
 “What are you going to do, Beatrice?”
 
 “Heaven knows. It seems my fate to fret away my years in this
 country. Not for a second do I regret being American—indeed, I
 think that a regret typical of very vulgar people, and I feel
 sure we are the great coming nation—yet”—and she sighed—“I feel
 my life should have drowsed away close to an older, mellower
 civilization, a land of greens and autumnal browns—”
 
 Amory did not answer, so his mother continued:
 
 “My regret is that you haven’t been abroad, but still, as you are
 a man, it’s better that you should grow up here under the
 snarling eagle—is that the right term?”
 
 Amory agreed that it was. She would not have appreciated the
 Japanese invasion.
 
 “When do I go to school?”
 
 “Next month. You’ll have to start East a little early to take
 your examinations. After that you’ll have a free week, so I want
 you to go up the Hudson and pay a visit.”
 
 “To who?”
 
 “To Monsignor Darcy, Amory. He wants to see you. He went to
 Harrow and then to Yale—became a Catholic. I want him to talk to
 you—I feel he can be such a help—” She stroked his auburn hair
 gently. “Dear Amory, dear Amory—”
 
 “Dear Beatrice—”
 
 
 So early in September Amory, provided with “six suits summer
 underwear, six suits winter underwear, one sweater or T shirt,
 one jersey, one overcoat, winter, etc.,” set out for New England,
 the land of schools.
 
 There were Andover and Exeter with their memories of New England
 dead—large, college-like democracies; St. Mark’s, Groton, St.
 Regis’—recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of
 New York; St. Paul’s, with its great rinks; Pomfret and St.
 George’s, prosperous and well-dressed; Taft and Hotchkiss, which
 prepared the wealth of the Middle West for social success at
 Yale; Pawling, Westminster, Choate, Kent, and a hundred others;
 all milling out their well-set-up, conventional, impressive type,
 year after year; their mental stimulus the college entrance
 exams; their vague purpose set forth in a hundred circulars as
 “To impart a Thorough Mental, Moral, and Physical Training as a
 Christian Gentleman, to fit the boy for meeting the problems of
 his day and generation, and to give a solid foundation in the
 Arts and Sciences.”
 
 At St. Regis’ Amory stayed three days and took his exams with a
 scoffing confidence, then doubling back to New York to pay his
 tutelary visit. The metropolis, barely glimpsed, made little
 impression on him, except for the sense of cleanliness he drew
 from the tall white buildings seen from a Hudson River steamboat
 in the early morning. Indeed, his mind was so crowded with dreams
 of athletic prowess at school that he considered this visit only
 as a rather tiresome prelude to the great adventure. This,
 however, it did not prove to be.
 
 Monsignor Darcy’s house was an ancient, rambling structure set on
 a hill overlooking the river, and there lived its owner, between
 his trips to all parts of the Roman-Catholic world, rather like
 an exiled Stuart king waiting to be called to the rule of his
 land. Monsignor was forty-four then, and bustling—a trifle too
 stout for symmetry, with hair the color of spun gold, and a
 brilliant, enveloping personality. When he came into a room clad
 in his full purple regalia from thatch to toe, he resembled a
 Turner sunset and attracted both admiration and attention. He
 had written two novels: one of them violently anti-Catholic, just
 before his conversion, and five years later another, in which he
 had attempted to turn all his clever jibes against Catholics into
 even cleverer innuendoes against Episcopalians. He was intensely
 ritualistic, startlingly dramatic, loved the idea of God enough
 to be a celibate, and rather liked his neighbor.
 
 Children adored him because he was like a child; youth revelled
 in his company because he was still a youth, and couldn’t be
 shocked. In the proper land and century he might have been a
 Richelieu—at present he was a very moral, very religious (if not
 particularly pious) clergyman, making a great mystery about
 pulling rusty wires, and appreciating life to the fullest, if not
 entirely enjoying it.
 
 He and Amory took to each other at first sight—the jovial,
 impressive prelate who could dazzle an embassy ball, and the
 green-eyed, intent youth, in his first long trousers, accepted in
 their own minds a relation of father and son within a half-hour’s
 conversation.
 
 “My dear boy, I’ve been waiting to see you for years. Take a big
 chair and we’ll have a chat.”
 
 “I’ve just come from school—St. Regis’s, you know.”
 
 “So your mother says—a remarkable woman; have a cigarette—I’m
 sure you smoke. Well, if you’re like me, you loathe all science
 and mathematics—”
 
 Amory nodded vehemently.
 
 “Hate ’em all. Like English and history.”
 
 “Of course. You’ll hate school for a while, too, but I’m glad
 you’re going to St. Regis’s.”
 
 “Why?”
 
 “Because it’s a gentleman’s school, and democracy won’t hit you
 so early. You’ll find plenty of that in college.”
 
 “I want to go to Princeton,” said Amory. “I don’t know why, but I
 think of all Harvard men as sissies, like I used to be, and all
 Yale men as wearing big blue sweaters and smoking pipes.”
 
 Monsignor chuckled.
 
 “I’m one, you know.”
 
 “Oh, you’re different—I think of Princeton as being lazy and
 good-looking and aristocratic—you know, like a spring day.
 Harvard seems sort of indoors—”
 
 “And Yale is November, crisp and energetic,” finished Monsignor.
 
 “That’s it.”
 
 They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never
 recovered.
 
 “I was for Bonnie Prince Charlie,” announced Amory.
 
 “Of course you were—and for Hannibal—”
 
 “Yes, and for the Southern Confederacy.” He was rather sceptical
 about being an Irish patriot—he suspected that being Irish was
 being somewhat common—but Monsignor assured him that Ireland was
 a romantic lost cause and Irish people quite charming, and that
 it should, by all means, be one of his principal biasses.
 
 After a crowded hour which included several more cigarettes, and
 during which Monsignor learned, to his surprise but not to his
 horror, that Amory had not been brought up a Catholic, he
 announced that he had another guest. This turned out to be the
 Honorable Thornton Hancock, of Boston, ex-minister to The Hague,
 author of an erudite history of the Middle Ages and the last of a
 distinguished, patriotic, and brilliant family.
 
 “He comes here for a rest,” said Monsignor confidentially,
 treating Amory as a contemporary. “I act as an escape from the
 weariness of agnosticism, and I think I’m the only man who knows
 how his staid old mind is really at sea and longs for a sturdy
 spar like the Church to cling to.”
 
 Their first luncheon was one of the memorable events of Amory’s
 early life. He was quite radiant and gave off a peculiar
 brightness and charm. Monsignor called out the best that he had
 thought by question and suggestion, and Amory talked with an
 ingenious brilliance of a thousand impulses and desires and
 repulsions and faiths and fears. He and Monsignor held the floor,
 and the older man, with his less receptive, less accepting, yet
 certainly not colder mentality, seemed content to listen and bask
 in the mellow sunshine that played between these two. Monsignor
 gave the effect of sunlight to many people; Amory gave it in his
 youth and, to some extent, when he was very much older, but never
 again was it quite so mutually spontaneous.
 
 “He’s a radiant boy,” thought Thornton Hancock, who had seen the
 splendor of two continents and talked with Parnell and Gladstone
 and Bismarck—and afterward he added to Monsignor: “But his
 education ought not to be intrusted to a school or college.”
 
 But for the next four years the best of Amory’s intellect was
 concentrated on matters of popularity, the intricacies of a
 university social system and American Society as represented by
 Biltmore Teas and Hot Springs golf-links.
 
 ... In all, a wonderful week, that saw Amory’s mind turned inside
 out, a hundred of his theories confirmed, and his joy of life
 crystallized to a thousand ambitions. Not that the conversation
 was scholastic—heaven forbid! Amory had only the vaguest idea as
 to what Bernard Shaw was—but Monsignor made quite as much out of
 “The Beloved Vagabond” and “Sir Nigel,” taking good care that
 Amory never once felt out of his depth.
 
 But the trumpets were sounding for Amory’s preliminary skirmish
 with his own generation.
 
 “You’re not sorry to go, of course. With people like us our home
 is where we are not,” said Monsignor.
 
 “I _am_ sorry—”
 
 “No, you’re not. No one person in the world is necessary to you
 or to me.”
 
 “Well—”
 
 “Good-by.”
 
 
 THE EGOTIST DOWN
 
 Amory’s two years at St. Regis’, though in turn painful and
 triumphant, had as little real significance in his own life as
 the American “prep” school, crushed as it is under the heel of
 the universities, has to American life in general. We have no
 Eton to create the self-consciousness of a governing class; we
 have, instead, clean, flaccid and innocuous preparatory schools.
 
 He went all wrong at the start, was generally considered both
 conceited and arrogant, and universally detested. He played
 football intensely, alternating a reckless brilliancy with a
 tendency to keep himself as safe from hazard as decency would
 permit. In a wild panic he backed out of a fight with a boy his
 own size, to a chorus of scorn, and a week later, in desperation,
 picked a battle with another boy very much bigger, from which he
 emerged badly beaten, but rather proud of himself.
 
 He was resentful against all those in authority over him, and
 this, combined with a lazy indifference toward his work,
 exasperated every master in school. He grew discouraged and
 imagined himself a pariah; took to sulking in corners and reading
 after lights. With a dread of being alone he attached a few
 friends, but since they were not among the elite of the school,
 he used them simply as mirrors of himself, audiences before which
 he might do that posing absolutely essential to him. He was
 unbearably lonely, desperately unhappy.
 
 There were some few grains of comfort. Whenever Amory was
 submerged, his vanity was the last part to go below the surface,
 so he could still enjoy a comfortable glow when “Wookey-wookey,”
 the deaf old housekeeper, told him that he was the best-looking
 boy she had ever seen. It had pleased him to be the lightest and
 youngest man on the first football squad; it pleased him when
 Doctor Dougall told him at the end of a heated conference that he
 could, if he wished, get the best marks in school. But Doctor
 Dougall was wrong. It was temperamentally impossible for Amory to
 get the best marks in school.
 
 Miserable, confined to bounds, unpopular with both faculty and
 students—that was Amory’s first term. But at Christmas he had
 returned to Minneapolis, tight-lipped and strangely jubilant.
 
 “Oh, I was sort of fresh at first,” he told Frog Parker
 patronizingly, “but I got along fine—lightest man on the squad.
 You ought to go away to school, Froggy. It’s great stuff.”
 
 
 INCIDENT OF THE WELL-MEANING PROFESSOR
 
 On the last night of his first term, Mr. Margotson, the senior
 master, sent word to study hall that Amory was to come to his
 room at nine. Amory suspected that advice was forthcoming, but he
 determined to be courteous, because this Mr. Margotson had been
 kindly disposed toward him.
 
 His summoner received him gravely, and motioned him to a chair.
 He hemmed several times and looked consciously kind, as a man
 will when he knows he’s on delicate ground.
 
 “Amory,” he began. “I’ve sent for you on a personal matter.”
 
 “Yes, sir.”
 
 “I’ve noticed you this year and I—I like you. I think you have in
 you the makings of a—a very good man.”
 
 “Yes, sir,” Amory managed to articulate. He hated having people
 talk as if he were an admitted failure.
 
 “But I’ve noticed,” continued the older man blindly, “that you’re
 not very popular with the boys.”
 
 “No, sir.” Amory licked his lips.
 
 “Ah—I thought you might not understand exactly what it was
 they—ah—objected to. I’m going to tell you, because I
 believe—ah—that when a boy knows his difficulties he’s better
 able to cope with them—to conform to what others expect of him.”
 He a-hemmed again with delicate reticence, and continued: “They
 seem to think that you’re—ah—rather too fresh—”
 
 Amory could stand no more. He rose from his chair, scarcely
 controlling his voice when he spoke.
 
 “I know—oh, _don’t_ you s’pose I know.” His voice rose. “I know
 what they think; do you s’pose you have to _tell_ me!” He paused.
 “I’m—I’ve got to go back now—hope I’m not rude—”
 
 He left the room hurriedly. In the cool air outside, as he walked
 to his house, he exulted in his refusal to be helped.
 
 “That _damn_ old fool!” he cried wildly. “As if I didn’t _know!_”
 
 He decided, however, that this was a good excuse not to go back
 to study hall that night, so, comfortably couched up in his room,
 he munched Nabiscos and finished “The White Company.”
 
 
 INCIDENT OF THE WONDERFUL GIRL
 
 There was a bright star in February. New York burst upon him on
 Washington’s Birthday with the brilliance of a long-anticipated
 event. His glimpse of it as a vivid whiteness against a deep-blue
 sky had left a picture of splendor that rivalled the dream cities
 in the Arabian Nights; but this time he saw it by electric light,
 and romance gleamed from the chariot-race sign on Broadway and
 from the women’s eyes at the Astor, where he and young Paskert
 from St. Regis’ had dinner. When they walked down the aisle of
 the theatre, greeted by the nervous twanging and discord of
 untuned violins and the sensuous, heavy fragrance of paint and
 powder, he moved in a sphere of epicurean delight. Everything
 enchanted him. The play was “The Little Millionaire,” with George
 M. Cohan, and there was one stunning young brunette who made him
 sit with brimming eyes in the ecstasy of watching her dance.
 
    “Oh—you—wonderful girl, What a wonderful girl you are—”
 
 sang the tenor, and Amory agreed silently, but passionately.
 
    “All—your—wonderful words Thrill me through—”
 
 The violins swelled and quavered on the last notes, the girl sank
 to a crumpled butterfly on the stage, a great burst of clapping
 filled the house. Oh, to fall in love like that, to the
 languorous magic melody of such a tune!
 
 The last scene was laid on a roof-garden, and the cellos sighed
 to the musical moon, while light adventure and facile froth-like
 comedy flitted back and forth in the calcium. Amory was on fire
 to be an habitui of roof-gardens, to meet a girl who should look
 like that—better, that very girl; whose hair would be drenched
 with golden moonlight, while at his elbow sparkling wine was
 poured by an unintelligible waiter. When the curtain fell for the
 last time he gave such a long sigh that the people in front of
 him twisted around and stared and said loud enough for him to
 hear:
 
 “What a _remarkable_-looking boy!”
 
 This took his mind off the play, and he wondered if he really did
 seem handsome to the population of New York.
 
 Paskert and he walked in silence toward their hotel. The former
 was the first to speak. His uncertain fifteen-year-old voice
 broke in in a melancholy strain on Amory’s musings:
 
 “I’d marry that girl to-night.”
 
 There was no need to ask what girl he referred to.
 
 “I’d be proud to take her home and introduce her to my people,”
 continued Paskert.
 
 Amory was distinctly impressed. He wished he had said it instead
 of Paskert. It sounded so mature.
 
 “I wonder about actresses; are they all pretty bad?”
 
 “No, _sir_, not by a darn sight,” said the worldly youth with
 emphasis, “and I know that girl’s as good as gold. I can tell.”
 
 They wandered on, mixing in the Broadway crowd, dreaming on the
 music that eddied out of the cafes. New faces flashed on and off
 like myriad lights, pale or rouged faces, tired, yet sustained by
 a weary excitement. Amory watched them in fascination. He was
 planning his life. He was going to live in New York, and be known
 at every restaurant and cafe, wearing a dress-suit from early
 evening to early morning, sleeping away the dull hours of the
 forenoon.
 
 “Yes, _sir_, I’d marry that girl to-night!”
 
 
 HEROIC IN GENERAL TONE
 
 October of his second and last year at St. Regis’ was a high
 point in Amory’s memory. The game with Groton was played from
 three of a snappy, exhilarating afternoon far into the crisp
 autumnal twilight, and Amory at quarter-back, exhorting in wild
 despair, making impossible tackles, calling signals in a voice
 that had diminished to a hoarse, furious whisper, yet found time
 to revel in the blood-stained bandage around his head, and the
 straining, glorious heroism of plunging, crashing bodies and
 aching limbs. For those minutes courage flowed like wine out of
 the November dusk, and he was the eternal hero, one with the
 sea-rover on the prow of a Norse galley, one with Roland and
 Horatius, Sir Nigel and Ted Coy, scraped and stripped into trim
 and then flung by his own will into the breach, beating back the
 tide, hearing from afar the thunder of cheers... finally bruised
 and weary, but still elusive, circling an end, twisting, changing
 pace, straight-arming... falling behind the Groton goal with two
 men on his legs, in the only touchdown of the game.
 
 
 THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SLICKER
 
 From the scoffing superiority of sixth-form year and success
 Amory looked back with cynical wonder on his status of the year
 before. He was changed as completely as Amory Blaine could ever
 be changed. Amory plus Beatrice plus two years in
 Minneapolis—these had been his ingredients when he entered St.
 Regis’. But the Minneapolis years were not a thick enough overlay
 to conceal the “Amory plus Beatrice” from the ferreting eyes of a
 boarding-school, so St. Regis’ had very painfully drilled
 Beatrice out of him, and begun to lay down new and more
 conventional planking on the fundamental Amory. But both St.
 Regis’ and Amory were unconscious of the fact that this
 fundamental Amory had not in himself changed. Those qualities for
 which he had suffered, his moodiness, his tendency to pose, his
 laziness, and his love of playing the fool, were now taken as a
 matter of course, recognized eccentricities in a star
 quarter-back, a clever actor, and the editor of the St. Regis
 Tattler: it puzzled him to see impressionable small boys
 imitating the very vanities that had not long ago been
 contemptible weaknesses.
 
 After the football season he slumped into dreamy content. The
 night of the pre-holiday dance he slipped away and went early to
 bed for the pleasure of hearing the violin music cross the grass
 and come surging in at his window. Many nights he lay there
 dreaming awake of secret cafes in Mont Martre, where ivory women
 delved in romantic mysteries with diplomats and soldiers of
 fortune, while orchestras played Hungarian waltzes and the air
 was thick and exotic with intrigue and moonlight and adventure.
 In the spring he read “L’Allegro,” by request, and was inspired
 to lyrical outpourings on the subject of Arcady and the pipes of
 Pan. He moved his bed so that the sun would wake him at dawn that
 he might dress and go out to the archaic swing that hung from an
 apple-tree near the sixth-form house. Seating himself in this he
 would pump higher and higher until he got the effect of swinging
 into the wide air, into a fairyland of piping satyrs and nymphs
 with the faces of fair-haired girls he passed in the streets of
 Eastchester. As the swing reached its highest point, Arcady
 really lay just over the brow of a certain hill, where the brown
 road dwindled out of sight in a golden dot.
 
 He read voluminously all spring, the beginning of his eighteenth
 year: “The Gentleman from Indiana,” “The New Arabian Nights,”
 “The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne,” “The Man Who Was Thursday,” which
 he liked without understanding; “Stover at Yale,” that became
 somewhat of a text-book; “Dombey and Son,” because he thought he
 really should read better stuff; Robert Chambers, David Graham
 Phillips, and E. Phillips Oppenheim complete, and a scattering of
 Tennyson and Kipling. Of all his class work only “L’Allegro” and
 some quality of rigid clarity in solid geometry stirred his
 languid interest.
 
 As June drew near, he felt the need of conversation to formulate
 his own ideas, and, to his surprise, found a co-philosopher in
 Rahill, the president of the sixth form. In many a talk, on the
 highroad or lying belly-down along the edge of the baseball
 diamond, or late at night with their cigarettes glowing in the
 dark, they threshed out the questions of school, and there was
 developed the term “slicker.”
 
 “Got tobacco?” whispered Rahill one night, putting his head
 inside the door five minutes after lights.
 
 “Sure.”
 
 “I’m coming in.”
 
 “Take a couple of pillows and lie in the window-seat, why don’t
 you.”
 
 Amory sat up in bed and lit a cigarette while Rahill settled for
 a conversation. Rahill’s favorite subject was the respective
 futures of the sixth form, and Amory never tired of outlining
 them for his benefit.
 
 “Ted Converse? ’At’s easy. He’ll fail his exams, tutor all summer
 at Harstrum’s, get into Sheff with about four conditions, and
 flunk out in the middle of the freshman year. Then he’ll go back
 West and raise hell for a year or so; finally his father will
 make him go into the paint business. He’ll marry and have four
 sons, all bone heads. He’ll always think St. Regis’s spoiled him,
 so he’ll send his sons to day school in Portland. He’ll die of
 locomotor ataxia when he’s forty-one, and his wife will give a
 baptizing stand or whatever you call it to the Presbyterian
 Church, with his name on it—”
 
 “Hold up, Amory. That’s too darned gloomy. How about yourself?”
 
 “I’m in a superior class. You are, too. We’re philosophers.”
 
 “I’m not.”
 
 “Sure you are. You’ve got a darn good head on you.” But Amory
 knew that nothing in the abstract, no theory or generality, ever
 moved Rahill until he stubbed his toe upon the concrete minutiae
 of it.
 
 “Haven’t,” insisted Rahill. “I let people impose on me here and
 don’t get anything out of it. I’m the prey of my friends, damn
 it—do their lessons, get ’em out of trouble, pay ’em stupid
 summer visits, and always entertain their kid sisters; keep my
 temper when they get selfish and then they think they pay me back
 by voting for me and telling me I’m the ‘big man’ of St. Regis’s.
 I want to get where everybody does their own work and I can tell
 people where to go. I’m tired of being nice to every poor fish in
 school.”
 
 “You’re not a slicker,” said Amory suddenly.
 
 “A what?”
 
 “A slicker.”
 
 “What the devil’s that?”
 
 “Well, it’s something that—that—there’s a lot of them. You’re not
 one, and neither am I, though I am more than you are.”
 
 “Who is one? What makes you one?”
 
 Amory considered.
 
 “Why—why, I suppose that the _sign_ of it is when a fellow slicks
 his hair back with water.”
 
 “Like Carstairs?”
 
 “Yes—sure. He’s a slicker.”
 
 They spent two evenings getting an exact definition. The slicker
 was good-looking or clean-looking; he had brains, social brains,
 that is, and he used all means on the broad path of honesty to
 get ahead, be popular, admired, and never in trouble. He dressed
 well, was particularly neat in appearance, and derived his name
 from the fact that his hair was inevitably worn short, soaked in
 water or tonic, parted in the middle, and slicked back as the
 current of fashion dictated. The slickers of that year had
 adopted tortoise-shell spectacles as badges of their slickerhood,
 and this made them so easy to recognize that Amory and Rahill
 never missed one. The slicker seemed distributed through school,
 always a little wiser and shrewder than his contemporaries,
 managing some team or other, and keeping his cleverness carefully
 concealed.
 
 Amory found the slicker a most valuable classification until his
 junior year in college, when the outline became so blurred and
 indeterminate that it had to be subdivided many times, and became
 only a quality. Amory’s secret ideal had all the slicker
 qualifications, but, in addition, courage and tremendous brains
 and talents—also Amory conceded him a bizarre streak that was
 quite irreconcilable to the slicker proper.
 
 This was a first real break from the hypocrisy of school
 tradition. The slicker was a definite element of success,
 differing intrinsically from the prep school “big man.”
 
   “THE SLICKER”
  1. Clever sense of social values.
  2. Dresses well.  Pretends that dress is superficial—but knows that it
  isn’t.
  3. Goes into such activities as he can shine in.
  4. Gets to college and is, in a worldly way, successful.
  5. Hair slicked.
   “THE BIG MAN”
  1. Inclined to stupidity and unconscious of social values.
  2. Thinks dress is superficial, and is inclined to be careless about
  it.
  3. Goes out for everything from a sense of duty.
  4. Gets to college and has a problematical future.  Feels lost without
  his circle, and always says that school days were happiest, after all.
   Goes back to school and makes speeches about what St. Regis’s boys

  5. Hair not slicked.
 
 Amory had decided definitely on Princeton, even though he would
 be the only boy entering that year from St. Regis’. Yale had a
 romance and glamour from the tales of Minneapolis, and St. Regis’
 men who had been “tapped for Skull and Bones,” but Princeton drew
 him most, with its atmosphere of bright colors and its alluring
 reputation as the pleasantest country club in America. Dwarfed by
 the menacing college exams, Amory’s school days drifted into the
 past. Years afterward, when he went back to St. Regis’, he seemed
 to have forgotten the successes of sixth-form year, and to be
 able to picture himself only as the unadjustable boy who had
 hurried down corridors, jeered at by his rabid contemporaries mad
 with common sense.
 
 CHAPTER 2. Spires and Gargoyles
 
 
 At first Amory noticed only the wealth of sunshine creeping
 across the long, green swards, dancing on the leaded
 window-panes, and swimming around the tops of spires and towers
 and battlemented walls. Gradually he realized that he was really
 walking up University Place, self-conscious about his suitcase,
 developing a new tendency to glare straight ahead when he passed
 any one. Several times he could have sworn that men turned to
 look at him critically. He wondered vaguely if there was
 something the matter with his clothes, and wished he had shaved
 that morning on the train. He felt unnecessarily stiff and
 awkward among these white-flannelled, bareheaded youths, who must
 be juniors and seniors, judging from the savoir faire with which
 they strolled.
 
 He found that 12 University Place was a large, dilapidated
 mansion, at present apparently uninhabited, though he knew it
 housed usually a dozen freshmen. After a hurried skirmish with
 his landlady he sallied out on a tour of exploration, but he had
 gone scarcely a block when he became horribly conscious that he
 must be the only man in town who was wearing a hat. He returned
 hurriedly to 12 University, left his derby, and, emerging
 bareheaded, loitered down Nassau Street, stopping to investigate
 a display of athletic photographs in a store window, including a
 large one of Allenby, the football captain, and next attracted by
 the sign “Jigger Shop” over a confectionary window. This sounded
 familiar, so he sauntered in and took a seat on a high stool.
 
 “Chocolate sundae,” he told a colored person.
 
 “Double chocolate jiggah? Anything else?”
 
 “Why—yes.”
 
 “Bacon bun?”
 
 “Why—yes.”
 
 He munched four of these, finding them of pleasing savor, and
 then consumed another double-chocolate jigger before ease
 descended upon him. After a cursory inspection of the
 pillow-cases, leather pennants, and Gibson Girls that lined the
 walls, he left, and continued along Nassau Street with his hands
 in his pockets. Gradually he was learning to distinguish between
 upper classmen and entering men, even though the freshman cap
 would not appear until the following Monday. Those who were too
 obviously, too nervously at home were freshmen, for as each train
 brought a new contingent it was immediately absorbed into the
 hatless, white-shod, book-laden throng, whose function seemed to
 be to drift endlessly up and down the street, emitting great
 clouds of smoke from brand-new pipes. By afternoon Amory realized
 that now the newest arrivals were taking him for an upper
 classman, and he tried conscientiously to look both pleasantly
 blasé and casually critical, which was as near as he could
 analyze the prevalent facial expression.
 
 At five o’clock he felt the need of hearing his own voice, so he
 retreated to his house to see if any one else had arrived. Having
 climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly,
 concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired
 decoration than class banners and tiger pictures. There was a tap
 at the door.
 
 “Come in!”
 
 A slim face with gray eyes and a humorous smile appeared in the
 doorway.
 
 “Got a hammer?”
 
 “No—sorry. Maybe Mrs. Twelve, or whatever she goes by, has one.”
 
 The stranger advanced into the room.
 
 “You an inmate of this asylum?”
 
 Amory nodded.
 
 “Awful barn for the rent we pay.”
 
 Amory had to agree that it was.
 
 “I thought of the campus,” he said, “but they say there’s so few
 freshmen that they’re lost. Have to sit around and study for
 something to do.”
 
 The gray-eyed man decided to introduce himself.
 
 “My name’s Holiday.”
 
 “Blaine’s my name.”
 
 They shook hands with the fashionable low swoop. Amory grinned.
 
 “Where’d you prep?”
 
 “Andover—where did you?”
 
 “St. Regis’s.”
 
 “Oh, did you? I had a cousin there.”
 
 They discussed the cousin thoroughly, and then Holiday announced
 that he was to meet his brother for dinner at six.
 
 “Come along and have a bite with us.”
 
 “All right.”
 
 At the Kenilworth Amory met Burne Holiday—he of the gray eyes was
 Kerry—and during a limpid meal of thin soup and anaemic
 vegetables they stared at the other freshmen, who sat either in
 small groups looking very ill at ease, or in large groups seeming
 very much at home.
 
 “I hear Commons is pretty bad,” said Amory.
 
 “That’s the rumor. But you’ve got to eat there—or pay anyways.”
 
 “Crime!”
 
 “Imposition!”
 
 “Oh, at Princeton you’ve got to swallow everything the first
 year. It’s like a damned prep school.”
 
 Amory agreed.
 
 “Lot of pep, though,” he insisted. “I wouldn’t have gone to Yale
 for a million.”
 
 “Me either.”
 
 “You going out for anything?” inquired Amory of the elder
 brother.
 
 “Not me—Burne here is going out for the Prince—the Daily
 Princetonian, you know.”
 
 “Yes, I know.”
 
 “You going out for anything?”
 
 “Why—yes. I’m going to take a whack at freshman football.”
 
 “Play at St. Regis’s?”
 
 “Some,” admitted Amory depreciatingly, “but I’m getting so damned
 thin.”
 
 “You’re not thin.”
 
 “Well, I used to be stocky last fall.”
 
 “Oh!”
 
 After supper they attended the movies, where Amory was fascinated
 by the glib comments of a man in front of him, as well as by the
 wild yelling and shouting.
 
 “Yoho!”
 
 “Oh, honey-baby—you’re so big and strong, but oh, so gentle!”
 
 “Clinch!”
 
 “Oh, Clinch!”
 
 “Kiss her, kiss ’at lady, quick!”
 
 “Oh-h-h—!”
 
 A group began whistling “By the Sea,” and the audience took it up
 noisily. This was followed by an indistinguishable song that
 included much stamping and then by an endless, incoherent dirge.
 
    “Oh-h-h-h-h She works in a Jam Factoree And—that-may-be-all-right
    But you can’t-fool-me For I know—DAMN—WELL That she
    DON’T-make-jam-all-night! Oh-h-h-h!”
 
 As they pushed out, giving and receiving curious impersonal
 glances, Amory decided that he liked the movies, wanted to enjoy
 them as the row of upper classmen in front had enjoyed them, with
 their arms along the backs of the seats, their comments Gaelic
 and caustic, their attitude a mixture of critical wit and
 tolerant amusement.
 
 “Want a sundae—I mean a jigger?” asked Kerry.
 
 “Sure.”
 
 They suppered heavily and then, still sauntering, eased back to
 12.
 
 “Wonderful night.”
 
 “It’s a whiz.”
 
 “You men going to unpack?”
 
 “Guess so. Come on, Burne.”
 
 Amory decided to sit for a while on the front steps, so he bade
 them good night.
 
 The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the
 last edge of twilight. The early moon had drenched the arches
 with pale blue, and, weaving over the night, in and out of the
 gossamer rifts of moon, swept a song, a song with more than a
 hint of sadness, infinitely transient, infinitely regretful.
 
 He remembered that an alumnus of the nineties had told him of one
 of Booth Tarkington’s amusements: standing in mid-campus in the
 small hours and singing tenor songs to the stars, arousing
 mingled emotions in the couched undergraduates according to the
 sentiment of their moods.
 
 Now, far down the shadowy line of University Place a white-clad
 phalanx broke the gloom, and marching figures, white-shirted,
 white-trousered, swung rhythmically up the street, with linked
 arms and heads thrown back:
 
    “Going back—going back, Going—back—to—Nas-sau—Hall, Going back—going
    back— To the—Best—Old—Place—of—All. Going back—going back, From
    all—this—earth-ly—ball, We’ll—clear—the—track—as—we—go—back—
    Going—back—to—Nas-sau—Hall!”
 
 Amory closed his eyes as the ghostly procession drew near. The
 song soared so high that all dropped out except the tenors, who
 bore the melody triumphantly past the danger-point and
 relinquished it to the fantastic chorus. Then Amory opened his
 eyes, half afraid that sight would spoil the rich illusion of
 harmony.
 
 He sighed eagerly. There at the head of the white platoon marched
 Allenby, the football captain, slim and defiant, as if aware that
 this year the hopes of the college rested on him, that his
 hundred-and-sixty pounds were expected to dodge to victory
 through the heavy blue and crimson lines.
 
 Fascinated, Amory watched each rank of linked arms as it came
 abreast, the faces indistinct above the polo shirts, the voices
 blent in a paean of triumph—and then the procession passed
 through shadowy Campbell Arch, and the voices grew fainter as it
 wound eastward over the campus.
 
 The minutes passed and Amory sat there very quietly. He regretted
 the rule that would forbid freshmen to be outdoors after curfew,
 for he wanted to ramble through the shadowy scented lanes, where
 Witherspoon brooded like a dark mother over Whig and Clio, her
 Attic children, where the black Gothic snake of Little curled
 down to Cuyler and Patton, these in turn flinging the mystery out
 over the placid slope rolling to the lake.
 
 
 Princeton of the daytime filtered slowly into his
 consciousness—West and Reunion, redolent of the sixties,
 Seventy-nine Hall, brick-red and arrogant, Upper and Lower Pyne,
 aristocratic Elizabethan ladies not quite content to live among
 shopkeepers, and, topping all, climbing with clear blue
 aspiration, the great dreaming spires of Holder and Cleveland
 towers.
 
 From the first he loved Princeton—its lazy beauty, its
 half-grasped significance, the wild moonlight revel of the
 rushes, the handsome, prosperous big-game crowds, and under it
 all the air of struggle that pervaded his class. From the day
 when, wild-eyed and exhausted, the jerseyed freshmen sat in the
 gymnasium and elected some one from Hill School class president,
 a Lawrenceville celebrity vice-president, a hockey star from St.
 Paul’s secretary, up until the end of sophomore year it never
 ceased, that breathless social system, that worship, seldom
 named, never really admitted, of the bogey “Big Man.”
 
 First it was schools, and Amory, alone from St. Regis’, watched
 the crowds form and widen and form again; St. Paul’s, Hill,
 Pomfret, eating at certain tacitly reserved tables in Commons,
 dressing in their own corners of the gymnasium, and drawing
 unconsciously about them a barrier of the slightly less important
 but socially ambitious to protect them from the friendly, rather
 puzzled high-school element. From the moment he realized this
 Amory resented social barriers as artificial distinctions made by
 the strong to bolster up their weak retainers and keep out the
 almost strong.
 
 Having decided to be one of the gods of the class, he reported
 for freshman football practice, but in the second week, playing
 quarter-back, already paragraphed in corners of the Princetonian,
 he wrenched his knee seriously enough to put him out for the rest
 of the season. This forced him to retire and consider the
 situation.
 
 “12 Univee” housed a dozen miscellaneous question-marks. There
 were three or four inconspicuous and quite startled boys from
 Lawrenceville, two amateur wild men from a New York private
 school (Kerry Holiday christened them the “plebeian drunks”), a
 Jewish youth, also from New York, and, as compensation for Amory,
 the two Holidays, to whom he took an instant fancy.
 
 The Holidays were rumored twins, but really the dark-haired one,
 Kerry, was a year older than his blond brother, Burne. Kerry was
 tall, with humorous gray eyes, and a sudden, attractive smile; he
 became at once the mentor of the house, reaper of ears that grew
 too high, censor of conceit, vendor of rare, satirical humor.
 Amory spread the table of their future friendship with all his
 ideas of what college should and did mean. Kerry, not inclined as
 yet to take things seriously, chided him gently for being curious
 at this inopportune time about the intricacies of the social
 system, but liked him and was both interested and amused.
 
 Burne, fair-haired, silent, and intent, appeared in the house
 only as a busy apparition, gliding in quietly at night and off
 again in the early morning to get up his work in the library—he
 was out for the Princetonian, competing furiously against forty
 others for the coveted first place. In December he came down with
 diphtheria, and some one else won the competition, but, returning
 to college in February, he dauntlessly went after the prize
 again. Necessarily, Amory’s acquaintance with him was in the way
 of three-minute chats, walking to and from lectures, so he failed
 to penetrate Burne’s one absorbing interest and find what lay
 beneath it.
 
 Amory was far from contented. He missed the place he had won at
 St. Regis’, the being known and admired, yet Princeton stimulated
 him, and there were many things ahead calculated to arouse the
 Machiavelli latent in him, could he but insert a wedge. The
 upper-class clubs, concerning which he had pumped a reluctant
 graduate during the previous summer, excited his curiosity: Ivy,
 detached and breathlessly aristocratic; Cottage, an impressive
 mélange of brilliant adventurers and well-dressed philanderers;
 Tiger Inn, broad-shouldered and athletic, vitalized by an honest
 elaboration of prep-school standards; Cap and Gown,
 anti-alcoholic, faintly religious and politically powerful;
 flamboyant Colonial; literary Quadrangle; and the dozen others,
 varying in age and position.
 
 Anything which brought an under classman into too glaring a light
 was labelled with the damning brand of “running it out.” The
 movies thrived on caustic comments, but the men who made them
 were generally running it out; talking of clubs was running it
 out; standing for anything very strongly, as, for instance,
 drinking parties or teetotalling, was running it out; in short,
 being personally conspicuous was not tolerated, and the
 influential man was the non-committal man, until at club
 elections in sophomore year every one should be sewed up in some
 bag for the rest of his college career.
 
 Amory found that writing for the Nassau Literary Magazine would
 get him nothing, but that being on the board of the Daily
 Princetonian would get any one a good deal. His vague desire to
 do immortal acting with the English Dramatic Association faded
 out when he found that the most ingenious brains and talents were
 concentrated upon the Triangle Club, a musical comedy
 organization that every year took a great Christmas trip. In the
 meanwhile, feeling strangely alone and restless in Commons, with
 new desires and ambitions stirring in his mind, he let the first
 term go by between an envy of the embryo successes and a puzzled
 fretting with Kerry as to why they were not accepted immediately
 among the elite of the class.
 
 Many afternoons they lounged in the windows of 12 Univee and
 watched the class pass to and from Commons, noting satellites
 already attaching themselves to the more prominent, watching the
 lonely grind with his hurried step and downcast eye, envying the
 happy security of the big school groups.
 
 “We’re the damned middle class, that’s what!” he complained to
 Kerry one day as he lay stretched out on the sofa, consuming a
 family of Fatimas with contemplative precision.
 
 “Well, why not? We came to Princeton so we could feel that way
 toward the small colleges—have it on ’em, more self-confidence,
 dress better, cut a swathe—”
 
 “Oh, it isn’t that I mind the glittering caste system,” admitted
 Amory. “I like having a bunch of hot cats on top, but gosh,
 Kerry, I’ve got to be one of them.”
 
 “But just now, Amory, you’re only a sweaty bourgeois.”
 
 Amory lay for a moment without speaking.
 
 “I won’t be—long,” he said finally. “But I hate to get anywhere
 by working for it. I’ll show the marks, don’t you know.”
 
 “Honorable scars.” Kerry craned his neck suddenly at the street.
 “There’s Langueduc, if you want to see what he looks like—and
 Humbird just behind.”
 
 Amory rose dynamically and sought the windows.
 
 “Oh,” he said, scrutinizing these worthies, “Humbird looks like a
 knock-out, but this Langueduc—he’s the rugged type, isn’t he? I
 distrust that sort. All diamonds look big in the rough.”
 
 “Well,” said Kerry, as the excitement subsided, “you’re a
 literary genius. It’s up to you.”
 
 “I wonder”—Amory paused—“if I could be. I honestly think so
 sometimes. That sounds like the devil, and I wouldn’t say it to
 anybody except you.”
 
 “Well—go ahead. Let your hair grow and write poems like this guy
 D’Invilliers in the Lit.”
 
 Amory reached lazily at a pile of magazines on the table.
 
 “Read his latest effort?”
 
 “Never miss ’em. They’re rare.”
 
 Amory glanced through the issue.
 
 “Hello!” he said in surprise, “he’s a freshman, isn’t he?”
 
 “Yeah.”
 
 “Listen to this! My God!
 
   “‘A serving lady speaks: Black velvet trails its folds over the day,
   White tapers, prisoned in their silver frames, Wave their thin flames
   like shadows in the wind, Pia, Pompia, come—come away—’
 
 “Now, what the devil does that mean?”
 
 “It’s a pantry scene.”
 
   “‘Her toes are stiffened like a stork’s in flight; She’s laid upon
   her bed, on the white sheets, Her hands pressed on her smooth bust
   like a saint, Bella Cunizza, come into the light!’
 
 “My gosh, Kerry, what in hell is it all about? I swear I don’t
 get him at all, and I’m a literary bird myself.”
 
 “It’s pretty tricky,” said Kerry, “only you’ve got to think of
 hearses and stale milk when you read it. That isn’t as pash as
 some of them.”
 
 Amory tossed the magazine on the table.
 
 “Well,” he sighed, “I sure am up in the air. I know I’m not a
 regular fellow, yet I loathe anybody else that isn’t. I can’t
 decide whether to cultivate my mind and be a great dramatist, or
 to thumb my nose at the Golden Treasury and be a Princeton
 slicker.”
 
 “Why decide?” suggested Kerry. “Better drift, like me. I’m going
 to sail into prominence on Burne’s coat-tails.”
 
 “I can’t drift—I want to be interested. I want to pull strings,
 even for somebody else, or be Princetonian chairman or Triangle
 president. I want to be admired, Kerry.”
 
 “You’re thinking too much about yourself.”
 
 Amory sat up at this.
 
 “No. I’m thinking about you, too. We’ve got to get out and mix
 around the class right now, when it’s fun to be a snob. I’d like
 to bring a sardine to the prom in June, for instance, but I
 wouldn’t do it unless I could be damn debonaire about
 it—introduce her to all the prize parlor-snakes, and the football
 captain, and all that simple stuff.”
 
 “Amory,” said Kerry impatiently, “you’re just going around in a
 circle. If you want to be prominent, get out and try for
 something; if you don’t, just take it easy.” He yawned. “Come on,
 let’s let the smoke drift off. We’ll go down and watch football
 practice.”
 
 
 Amory gradually accepted this point of view, decided that next
 fall would inaugurate his career, and relinquished himself to
 watching Kerry extract joy from 12 Univee.
 
 They filled the Jewish youth’s bed with lemon pie; they put out
 the gas all over the house every night by blowing into the jet in
 Amory’s room, to the bewilderment of Mrs. Twelve and the local
 plumber; they set up the effects of the plebeian drunks—pictures,
 books, and furniture—in the bathroom, to the confusion of the
 pair, who hazily discovered the transposition on their return
 from a Trenton spree; they were disappointed beyond measure when
 the plebeian drunks decided to take it as a joke; they played
 red-dog and twenty-one and jackpot from dinner to dawn, and on
 the occasion of one man’s birthday persuaded him to buy
 sufficient champagne for a hilarious celebration. The donor of
 the party having remained sober, Kerry and Amory accidentally
 dropped him down two flights of stairs and called, shame-faced
 and penitent, at the infirmary all the following week.
 
 “Say, who are all these women?” demanded Kerry one day,
 protesting at the size of Amory’s mail. “I’ve been looking at the
 postmarks lately—Farmington and Dobbs and Westover and Dana
 Hall—what’s the idea?”
 
 Amory grinned.
 
 “All from the Twin Cities.” He named them off. “There’s Marylyn
 De Witt—she’s pretty, got a car of her own and that’s damn
 convenient; there’s Sally Weatherby—she’s getting too fat;
 there’s Myra St. Claire, she’s an old flame, easy to kiss if you
 like it—”
 
 “What line do you throw ’em?” demanded Kerry. “I’ve tried
 everything, and the mad wags aren’t even afraid of me.”
 
 “You’re the ‘nice boy’ type,” suggested Amory.
 
 “That’s just it. Mother always feels the girl is safe if she’s
 with me. Honestly, it’s annoying. If I start to hold somebody’s
 hand, they laugh at me, and let me, just as if it wasn’t part of
 them. As soon as I get hold of a hand they sort of disconnect it
 from the rest of them.”
 
 “Sulk,” suggested Amory. “Tell ’em you’re wild and have ’em
 reform you—go home furious—come back in half an hour—startle
 ’em.”
 
 Kerry shook his head.
 
 “No chance. I wrote a St. Timothy girl a really loving letter
 last year. In one place I got rattled and said: ‘My God, how I
 love you!’ She took a nail scissors, clipped out the ‘My God’ and
 showed the rest of the letter all over school. Doesn’t work at
 all. I’m just ‘good old Kerry’ and all that rot.”
 
 Amory smiled and tried to picture himself as “good old Amory.” He
 failed completely.
 
 February dripped snow and rain, the cyclonic freshman mid-years
 passed, and life in 12 Univee continued interesting if not
 purposeful. Once a day Amory indulged in a club sandwich,
 cornflakes, and Julienne potatoes at “Joe’s,” accompanied usually
 by Kerry or Alec Connage. The latter was a quiet, rather aloof
 slicker from Hotchkiss, who lived next door and shared the same
 enforced singleness as Amory, due to the fact that his entire
 class had gone to Yale. “Joe’s” was unaesthetic and faintly
 unsanitary, but a limitless charge account could be opened there,
 a convenience that Amory appreciated. His father had been
 experimenting with mining stocks and, in consequence, his
 allowance, while liberal, was not at all what he had expected.
 
 “Joe’s” had the additional advantage of seclusion from curious
 upper-class eyes, so at four each afternoon Amory, accompanied by
 friend or book, went up to experiment with his digestion. One day
 in March, finding that all the tables were occupied, he slipped
 into a chair opposite a freshman who bent intently over a book at
 the last table. They nodded briefly. For twenty minutes Amory sat
 consuming bacon buns and reading “Mrs. Warren’s Profession” (he
 had discovered Shaw quite by accident while browsing in the
 library during mid-years); the other freshman, also intent on his
 volume, meanwhile did away with a trio of chocolate malted milks.
 
 By and by Amory’s eyes wandered curiously to his fellow-luncher’s
 book. He spelled out the name and title upside down—“Marpessa,”
 by Stephen Phillips. This meant nothing to him, his metrical
 education having been confined to such Sunday classics as “Come
 into the Garden, Maude,” and what morsels of Shakespeare and
 Milton had been recently forced upon him.
 
 Moved to address his vis-a-vis, he simulated interest in his book
 for a moment, and then exclaimed aloud as if involuntarily:
 
 “Ha! Great stuff!”
 
 The other freshman looked up and Amory registered artificial
 embarrassment.
 
 “Are you referring to your bacon buns?” His cracked, kindly voice
 went well with the large spectacles and the impression of a
 voluminous keenness that he gave.
 
 “No,” Amory answered. “I was referring to Bernard Shaw.” He
 turned the book around in explanation.
 
 “I’ve never read any Shaw. I’ve always meant to.” The boy paused
 and then continued: “Did you ever read Stephen Phillips, or do
 you like poetry?”
 
 “Yes, indeed,” Amory affirmed eagerly. “I’ve never read much of
 Phillips, though.” (He had never heard of any Phillips except the
 late David Graham.)
 
 “It’s pretty fair, I think. Of course he’s a Victorian.” They
 sallied into a discussion of poetry, in the course of which they
 introduced themselves, and Amory’s companion proved to be none
 other than “that awful highbrow, Thomas Parke D’Invilliers,” who
 signed the passionate love-poems in the Lit. He was, perhaps,
 nineteen, with stooped shoulders, pale blue eyes, and, as Amory
 could tell from his general appearance, without much conception
 of social competition and such phenomena of absorbing interest.
 Still, he liked books, and it seemed forever since Amory had met
 any one who did; if only that St. Paul’s crowd at the next table
 would not mistake _him_ for a bird, too, he would enjoy the
 encounter tremendously. They didn’t seem to be noticing, so he
 let himself go, discussed books by the dozens—books he had read,
 read about, books he had never heard of, rattling off lists of
 titles with the facility of a Brentano’s clerk. D’Invilliers was
 partially taken in and wholly delighted. In a good-natured way he
 had almost decided that Princeton was one part deadly Philistines
 and one part deadly grinds, and to find a person who could
 mention Keats without stammering, yet evidently washed his hands,
 was rather a treat.
 
 “Ever read any Oscar Wilde?” he asked.
 
 “No. Who wrote it?”
 
 “It’s a man—don’t you know?”
 
 “Oh, surely.” A faint chord was struck in Amory’s memory. “Wasn’t
 the comic opera, ‘Patience,’ written about him?”
 
 “Yes, that’s the fella. I’ve just finished a book of his, ‘The
 Picture of Dorian Gray,’ and I certainly wish you’d read it.
 You’d like it. You can borrow it if you want to.”
 
 “Why, I’d like it a lot—thanks.”
 
 “Don’t you want to come up to the room? I’ve got a few other
 books.”
 
 Amory hesitated, glanced at the St. Paul’s group—one of them was
 the magnificent, exquisite Humbird—and he considered how
 determinate the addition of this friend would be. He never got to
 the stage of making them and getting rid of them—he was not hard
 enough for that—so he measured Thomas Parke D’Invilliers’
 undoubted attractions and value against the menace of cold eyes
 behind tortoise-rimmed spectacles that he fancied glared from the
 next table.
 
 “Yes, I’ll go.”
 
 So he found “Dorian Gray” and the “Mystic and Somber Dolores” and
 the “Belle Dame sans Merci”; for a month was keen on naught else.
 The world became pale and interesting, and he tried hard to look
 at Princeton through the satiated eyes of Oscar Wilde and
 Swinburne—or “Fingal O’Flaherty” and “Algernon Charles,” as he
 called them in precieuse jest. He read enormously every
 night—Shaw, Chesterton, Barrie, Pinero, Yeats, Synge, Ernest
 Dowson, Arthur Symons, Keats, Sudermann, Robert Hugh Benson, the
 Savoy Operas—just a heterogeneous mixture, for he suddenly
 discovered that he had read nothing for years.
 
 Tom D’Invilliers became at first an occasion rather than a
 friend. Amory saw him about once a week, and together they gilded
 the ceiling of Tom’s room and decorated the walls with imitation
 tapestry, bought at an auction, tall candlesticks and figured
 curtains. Amory liked him for being clever and literary without
 effeminacy or affectation. In fact, Amory did most of the
 strutting and tried painfully to make every remark an epigram,
 than which, if one is content with ostensible epigrams, there are
 many feats harder. 12 Univee was amused. Kerry read “Dorian Gray”
 and simulated Lord Henry, following Amory about, addressing him
 as “Dorian” and pretending to encourage in him wicked fancies and
 attenuated tendencies to ennui. When he carried it into Commons,
 to the amazement of the others at table, Amory became furiously
 embarrassed, and after that made epigrams only before
 D’Invilliers or a convenient mirror.
 
 One day Tom and Amory tried reciting their own and Lord Dunsany’s
 poems to the music of Kerry’s graphophone.
 
 “Chant!” cried Tom. “Don’t recite! Chant!”
 
 Amory, who was performing, looked annoyed, and claimed that he
 needed a record with less piano in it. Kerry thereupon rolled on
 the floor in stifled laughter.
 
 “Put on ‘Hearts and Flowers’!” he howled. “Oh, my Lord, I’m going
 to cast a kitten.”
 
 “Shut off the damn graphophone,” Amory cried, rather red in the
 face. “I’m not giving an exhibition.”
 
 In the meanwhile Amory delicately kept trying to awaken a sense
 of the social system in D’Invilliers, for he knew that this poet
 was really more conventional than he, and needed merely watered
 hair, a smaller range of conversation, and a darker brown hat to
 become quite regular. But the liturgy of Livingstone collars and
 dark ties fell on heedless ears; in fact D’Invilliers faintly
 resented his efforts; so Amory confined himself to calls once a
 week, and brought him occasionally to 12 Univee. This caused mild
 titters among the other freshmen, who called them “Doctor Johnson
 and Boswell.”
 
 Alec Connage, another frequent visitor, liked him in a vague way,
 but was afraid of him as a highbrow. Kerry, who saw through his
 poetic patter to the solid, almost respectable depths within, was
 immensely amused and would have him recite poetry by the hour,
 while he lay with closed eyes on Amory’s sofa and listened:
 
    “Asleep or waking is it? for her neck Kissed over close, wears yet a
    purple speck Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out; Soft and
    stung softly—fairer for a fleck...”
 
 “That’s good,” Kerry would say softly. “It pleases the elder
 Holiday. That’s a great poet, I guess.” Tom, delighted at an
 audience, would ramble through the “Poems and Ballades” until
 Kerry and Amory knew them almost as well as he.
 
 Amory took to writing poetry on spring afternoons, in the gardens
 of the big estates near Princeton, while swans made effective
 atmosphere in the artificial pools, and slow clouds sailed
 harmoniously above the willows. May came too soon, and suddenly
 unable to bear walls, he wandered the campus at all hours through
 starlight and rain.
 
 
 A DAMP SYMBOLIC INTERLUDE
 
 The night mist fell. From the moon it rolled, clustered about the
 spires and towers, and then settled below them, so that the
 dreaming peaks were still in lofty aspiration toward the sky.
 Figures that dotted the day like ants now brushed along as
 shadowy ghosts, in and out of the foreground. The Gothic halls
 and cloisters were infinitely more mysterious as they loomed
 suddenly out of the darkness, outlined each by myriad faint
 squares of yellow light. Indefinitely from somewhere a bell
 boomed the quarter-hour, and Amory, pausing by the sun-dial,
 stretched himself out full length on the damp grass. The cool
 bathed his eyes and slowed the flight of time—time that had crept
 so insidiously through the lazy April afternoons, seemed so
 intangible in the long spring twilights. Evening after evening
 the senior singing had drifted over the campus in melancholy
 beauty, and through the shell of his undergraduate consciousness
 had broken a deep and reverent devotion to the gray walls and
 Gothic peaks and all they symbolized as warehouses of dead ages.
 
 The tower that in view of his window sprang upward, grew into a
 spire, yearning higher until its uppermost tip was half invisible
 against the morning skies, gave him the first sense of the
 transiency and unimportance of the campus figures except as
 holders of the apostolic succession. He liked knowing that Gothic
 architecture, with its upward trend, was peculiarly appropriate
 to universities, and the idea became personal to him. The silent
 stretches of green, the quiet halls with an occasional
 late-burning scholastic light held his imagination in a strong
 grasp, and the chastity of the spire became a symbol of this
 perception.
 
 “Damn it all,” he whispered aloud, wetting his hands in the damp
 and running them through his hair. “Next year I work!” Yet he
 knew that where now the spirit of spires and towers made him
 dreamily acquiescent, it would then overawe him. Where now he
 realized only his own inconsequence, effort would make him aware
 of his own impotency and insufficiency.
 
 The college dreamed on—awake. He felt a nervous excitement that
 might have been the very throb of its slow heart. It was a stream
 where he was to throw a stone whose faint ripple would be
 vanishing almost as it left his hand. As yet he had given
 nothing, he had taken nothing.
 
 A belated freshman, his oilskin slicker rasping loudly, slushed
 along the soft path. A voice from somewhere called the inevitable
 formula, “Stick out your head!” below an unseen window. A hundred
 little sounds of the current drifting on under the fog pressed in
 finally on his consciousness.
 
 “Oh, God!” he cried suddenly, and started at the sound of his
 voice in the stillness. The rain dripped on. A minute longer he
 lay without moving, his hands clinched. Then he sprang to his
 feet and gave his clothes a tentative pat.
 
 “I’m very damn wet!” he said aloud to the sun-dial.
 
 
 HISTORICAL
 
 The war began in the summer following his freshman year. Beyond a
 sporting interest in the German dash for Paris the whole affair
 failed either to thrill or interest him. With the attitude he
 might have held toward an amusing melodrama he hoped it would be
 long and bloody. If it had not continued he would have felt like
 an irate ticket-holder at a prize-fight where the principals
 refused to mix it up.
 
 That was his total reaction.
 
 
 “HA-HA HORTENSE!”
 
 “All right, ponies!”
 
 “Shake it up!”
 
 “Hey, ponies—how about easing up on that crap game and shaking a
 mean hip?”
 
 “Hey, _ponies!_”
 
 The coach fumed helplessly, the Triangle Club president,
 glowering with anxiety, varied between furious bursts of
 authority and fits of temperamental lassitude, when he sat
 spiritless and wondered how the devil the show was ever going on
 tour by Christmas.
 
 “All right. We’ll take the pirate song.”
 
 The ponies took last drags at their cigarettes and slumped into
 place; the leading lady rushed into the foreground, setting his
 hands and feet in an atmospheric mince; and as the coach clapped
 and stamped and tumped and da-da’d, they hashed out a dance.
 
 A great, seething ant-hill was the Triangle Club. It gave a
 musical comedy every year, travelling with cast, chorus,
 orchestra, and scenery all through Christmas vacation. The play
 and music were the work of undergraduates, and the club itself
 was the most influential of institutions, over three hundred men
 competing for it every year.
 
 Amory, after an easy victory in the first sophomore Princetonian
 competition, stepped into a vacancy of the cast as Boiling Oil, a
 Pirate Lieutenant. Every night for the last week they had
 rehearsed “Ha-Ha Hortense!” in the Casino, from two in the
 afternoon until eight in the morning, sustained by dark and
 powerful coffee, and sleeping in lectures through the interim. A
 rare scene, the Casino. A big, barnlike auditorium, dotted with
 boys as girls, boys as pirates, boys as babies; the scenery in
 course of being violently set up; the spotlight man rehearsing by
 throwing weird shafts into angry eyes; over all the constant
 tuning of the orchestra or the cheerful tumpty-tump of a Triangle
 tune. The boy who writes the lyrics stands in the corner, biting
 a pencil, with twenty minutes to think of an encore; the business
 manager argues with the secretary as to how much money can be
 spent on “those damn milkmaid costumes”; the old graduate,
 president in ninety-eight, perches on a box and thinks how much
 simpler it was in his day.
 
 How a Triangle show ever got off was a mystery, but it was a
 riotous mystery, anyway, whether or not one did enough service to
 wear a little gold Triangle on his watch-chain. “Ha-Ha Hortense!”
 was written over six times and had the names of nine
 collaborators on the programme. All Triangle shows started by
 being “something different—not just a regular musical comedy,”
 but when the several authors, the president, the coach and the
 faculty committee finished with it, there remained just the old
 reliable Triangle show with the old reliable jokes and the star
 comedian who got expelled or sick or something just before the
 trip, and the dark-whiskered man in the pony-ballet, who
 “absolutely won’t shave twice a day, doggone it!”
 
 There was one brilliant place in “Ha-Ha Hortense!” It is a
 Princeton tradition that whenever a Yale man who is a member of
 the widely advertised “Skull and Bones” hears the sacred name
 mentioned, he must leave the room. It is also a tradition that
 the members are invariably successful in later life, amassing
 fortunes or votes or coupons or whatever they choose to amass.
 Therefore, at each performance of “Ha-Ha Hortense!” half-a-dozen
 seats were kept from sale and occupied by six of the
 worst-looking vagabonds that could be hired from the streets,
 further touched up by the Triangle make-up man. At the moment in
 the show where Firebrand, the Pirate Chief, pointed at his black
 flag and said, “I am a Yale graduate—note my Skull and Bones!”—at
 this very moment the six vagabonds were instructed to rise
 _conspicuously_ and leave the theatre with looks of deep
 melancholy and an injured dignity. It was claimed though never
 proved that on one occasion the hired Elis were swelled by one of
 the real thing.
 
 They played through vacation to the fashionable of eight cities.
 Amory liked Louisville and Memphis best: these knew how to meet
 strangers, furnished extraordinary punch, and flaunted an
 astonishing array of feminine beauty. Chicago he approved for a
 certain verve that transcended its loud accent—however, it was a
 Yale town, and as the Yale Glee Club was expected in a week the
 Triangle received only divided homage. In Baltimore, Princeton
 was at home, and every one fell in love. There was a proper
 consumption of strong waters all along the line; one man
 invariably went on the stage highly stimulated, claiming that his
 particular interpretation of the part required it. There were
 three private cars; however, no one slept except in the third
 car, which was called the “animal car,” and where were herded the
 spectacled wind-jammers of the orchestra. Everything was so
 hurried that there was no time to be bored, but when they arrived
 in Philadelphia, with vacation nearly over, there was rest in
 getting out of the heavy atmosphere of flowers and grease-paint,
 and the ponies took off their corsets with abdominal pains and
 sighs of relief.
 
 When the disbanding came, Amory set out post haste for
 Minneapolis, for Sally Weatherby’s cousin, Isabelle Borge, was
 coming to spend the winter in Minneapolis while her parents went
 abroad. He remembered Isabelle only as a little girl with whom he
 had played sometimes when he first went to Minneapolis. She had
 gone to Baltimore to live—but since then she had developed a
 past.
 
 Amory was in full stride, confident, nervous, and jubilant.
 Scurrying back to Minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a
 child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do, so without
 compunction he wired his mother not to expect him... sat in the
 train, and thought about himself for thirty-six hours.
 
 
 “PETTING”
 
 On the Triangle trip Amory had come into constant contact with
 that great current American phenomenon, the “petting party.”
 
 None of the Victorian mothers—and most of the mothers were
 Victorian—had any idea how casually their daughters were
 accustomed to be kissed. “Servant-girls are that way,” says Mrs.
 Huston-Carmelite to her popular daughter. “They are kissed first
 and proposed to afterward.”
 
 But the Popular Daughter becomes engaged every six months between
 sixteen and twenty-two, when she arranges a match with young
 Hambell, of Cambell & Hambell, who fatuously considers himself
 her first love, and between engagements the P. D. (she is
 selected by the cut-in system at dances, which favors the
 survival of the fittest) has other sentimental last kisses in the
 moonlight, or the firelight, or the outer darkness.
 
 Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have
 been impossible: eating three-o’clock, after-dance suppers in
 impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half
 of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement
 that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he
 never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities
 between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue.
 
 Afternoon at the Plaza, with winter twilight hovering outside and
 faint drums down-stairs... they strut and fret in the lobby,
 taking another cocktail, scrupulously attired and waiting. Then
 the swinging doors revolve and three bundles of fur mince in. The
 theatre comes afterward; then a table at the Midnight Frolic—of
 course, mother will be along there, but she will serve only to
 make things more secretive and brilliant as she sits in solitary
 state at the deserted table and thinks such entertainments as
 this are not half so bad as they are painted, only rather
 wearying. But the P. D. is in love again... it was odd, wasn’t
 it?—that though there was so much room left in the taxi the P. D.
 and the boy from Williams were somehow crowded out and had to go
 in a separate car. Odd! Didn’t you notice how flushed the P. D.
 was when she arrived just seven minutes late? But the P. D. “gets
 away with it.”
 
 The “belle” had become the “flirt,” the “flirt” had become the
 “baby vamp.” The “belle” had five or six callers every afternoon.
 If the P. D., by some strange accident, has two, it is made
 pretty uncomfortable for the one who hasn’t a date with her. The
 “belle” was surrounded by a dozen men in the intermissions
 between dances. Try to find the P. D. between dances, just _try_
 to find her.
 
 The same girl... deep in an atmosphere of jungle music and the
 questioning of moral codes. Amory found it rather fascinating to
 feel that any popular girl he met before eight he might quite
 possibly kiss before twelve.
 
 “Why on earth are we here?” he asked the girl with the green
 combs one night as they sat in some one’s limousine, outside the
 Country Club in Louisville.
 
 “I don’t know. I’m just full of the devil.”
 
 “Let’s be frank—we’ll never see each other again. I wanted to
 come out here with you because I thought you were the
 best-looking girl in sight. You really don’t care whether you
 ever see me again, do you?”
 
 “No—but is this your line for every girl? What have I done to
 deserve it?”
 
 “And you didn’t feel tired dancing or want a cigarette or any of
 the things you said? You just wanted to be—”
 
 “Oh, let’s go in,” she interrupted, “if you want to _analyze_.
 Let’s not _talk_ about it.”
 
 When the hand-knit, sleeveless jerseys were stylish, Amory, in a
 burst of inspiration, named them “petting shirts.” The name
 travelled from coast to coast on the lips of parlor-snakes and P.
 D.’s.
 
 
 DESCRIPTIVE
 
 Amory was now eighteen years old, just under six feet tall and
 exceptionally, but not conventionally, handsome. He had rather a
 young face, the ingenuousness of which was marred by the
 penetrating green eyes, fringed with long dark eyelashes. He
 lacked somehow that intense animal magnetism that so often
 accompanies beauty in men or women; his personality seemed rather
 a mental thing, and it was not in his power to turn it on and off
 like a water-faucet. But people never forgot his face.
 
 
 ISABELLE
 
 She paused at the top of the staircase. The sensations attributed
 to divers on spring-boards, leading ladies on opening nights, and
 lumpy, husky young men on the day of the Big Game, crowded
 through her. She should have descended to a burst of drums or a
 discordant blend of themes from “Thais” and “Carmen.” She had
 never been so curious about her appearance, she had never been so
 satisfied with it. She had been sixteen years old for six months.
 
 “Isabelle!” called her cousin Sally from the doorway of the
 dressing-room.
 
 “I’m ready.” She caught a slight lump of nervousness in her
 throat.
 
 “I had to send back to the house for another pair of slippers.
 It’ll be just a minute.”
 
 Isabelle started toward the dressing-room for a last peek in the
 mirror, but something decided her to stand there and gaze down
 the broad stairs of the Minnehaha Club. They curved
 tantalizingly, and she could catch just a glimpse of two pairs of
 masculine feet in the hall below. Pump-shod in uniform black,
 they gave no hint of identity, but she wondered eagerly if one
 pair were attached to Amory Blaine. This young man, not as yet
 encountered, had nevertheless taken up a considerable part of her
 day—the first day of her arrival. Coming up in the machine from
 the station, Sally had volunteered, amid a rain of question,
 comment, revelation, and exaggeration:
 
 “You remember Amory Blaine, of _course_. Well, he’s simply mad to
 see you again. He’s stayed over a day from college, and he’s
 coming to-night. He’s heard so much about you—says he remembers
 your eyes.”
 
 This had pleased Isabelle. It put them on equal terms, although
 she was quite capable of staging her own romances, with or
 without advance advertising. But following her happy tremble of
 anticipation, came a sinking sensation that made her ask:
 
 “How do you mean he’s heard about me? What sort of things?”
 
 Sally smiled. She felt rather in the capacity of a showman with
 her more exotic cousin.
 
 “He knows you’re—you’re considered beautiful and all that”—she
 paused—“and I guess he knows you’ve been kissed.”
 
 At this Isabelle’s little fist had clinched suddenly under the
 fur robe. She was accustomed to be thus followed by her desperate
 past, and it never failed to rouse in her the same feeling of
 resentment; yet—in a strange town it was an advantageous
 reputation. She was a “Speed,” was she? Well—let them find out.
 
 Out of the window Isabelle watched the snow glide by in the
 frosty morning. It was ever so much colder here than in
 Baltimore; she had not remembered; the glass of the side door was
 iced, the windows were shirred with snow in the corners. Her mind
 played still with one subject. Did _he_ dress like that boy
 there, who walked calmly down a bustling business street, in
 moccasins and winter-carnival costume? How very _Western!_ Of
 course he wasn’t that way: he went to Princeton, was a sophomore
 or something. Really she had no distinct idea of him. An ancient
 snap-shot she had preserved in an old kodak book had impressed
 her by the big eyes (which he had probably grown up to by now).
 However, in the last month, when her winter visit to Sally had
 been decided on, he had assumed the proportions of a worthy
 adversary. Children, most astute of match-makers, plot their
 campaigns quickly, and Sally had played a clever correspondence
 sonata to Isabelle’s excitable temperament. Isabelle had been for
 some time capable of very strong, if very transient emotions....
 
 They drew up at a spreading, white-stone building, set back from
 the snowy street. Mrs. Weatherby greeted her warmly and her
 various younger cousins were produced from the corners where they
 skulked politely. Isabelle met them tactfully. At her best she
 allied all with whom she came in contact—except older girls and
 some women. All the impressions she made were conscious. The
 half-dozen girls she renewed acquaintance with that morning were
 all rather impressed and as much by her direct personality as by
 her reputation. Amory Blaine was an open subject. Evidently a bit
 light of love, neither popular nor unpopular—every girl there
 seemed to have had an affair with him at some time or other, but
 no one volunteered any really useful information. He was going to
 fall for her.... Sally had published that information to her
 young set and they were retailing it back to Sally as fast as
 they set eyes on Isabelle. Isabelle resolved secretly that she
 would, if necessary, _force_ herself to like him—she owed it to
 Sally. Suppose she were terribly disappointed. Sally had painted
 him in such glowing colors—he was good-looking, “sort of
 distinguished, when he wants to be,” had a line, and was properly
 inconstant. In fact, he summed up all the romance that her age
 and environment led her to desire. She wondered if those were his
 dancing-shoes that fox-trotted tentatively around the soft rug
 below.
 
 All impressions and, in fact, all ideas were extremely
 kaleidoscopic to Isabelle. She had that curious mixture of the
 social and the artistic temperaments found often in two classes,
 society women and actresses. Her education or, rather, her
 sophistication, had been absorbed from the boys who had dangled
 on her favor; her tact was instinctive, and her capacity for
 love-affairs was limited only by the number of the susceptible
 within telephone distance. Flirt smiled from her large
 black-brown eyes and shone through her intense physical
 magnetism.
 
 So she waited at the head of the stairs that evening while
 slippers were fetched. Just as she was growing impatient, Sally
 came out of the dressing-room, beaming with her accustomed good
 nature and high spirits, and together they descended to the floor
 below, while the shifting search-light of Isabelle’s mind flashed
 on two ideas: she was glad she had high color to-night, and she
 wondered if he danced well.
 
 Down-stairs, in the club’s great room, she was surrounded for a
 moment by the girls she had met in the afternoon, then she heard
 Sally’s voice repeating a cycle of names, and found herself
 bowing to a sextet of black and white, terribly stiff, vaguely
 familiar figures. The name Blaine figured somewhere, but at first
 she could not place him. A very confused, very juvenile moment of
 awkward backings and bumpings followed, and every one found
 himself talking to the person he least desired to. Isabelle
 manoeuvred herself and Froggy Parker, freshman at Harvard, with
 whom she had once played hop-scotch, to a seat on the stairs. A
 humorous reference to the past was all she needed. The things
 Isabelle could do socially with one idea were remarkable. First,
 she repeated it rapturously in an enthusiastic contralto with a
 soupcon of Southern accent; then she held it off at a distance
 and smiled at it—her wonderful smile; then she delivered it in
 variations and played a sort of mental catch with it, all this in
 the nominal form of dialogue. Froggy was fascinated and quite
 unconscious that this was being done, not for him, but for the
 green eyes that glistened under the shining carefully watered
 hair, a little to her left, for Isabelle had discovered Amory. As
 an actress even in the fullest flush of her own conscious
 magnetism gets a deep impression of most of the people in the
 front row, so Isabelle sized up her antagonist. First, he had
 auburn hair, and from her feeling of disappointment she knew that
 she had expected him to be dark and of garter-advertisement
 slenderness.... For the rest, a faint flush and a straight,
 romantic profile; the effect set off by a close-fitting dress
 suit and a silk ruffled shirt of the kind that women still
 delight to see men wear, but men were just beginning to get tired
 of.
 
 During this inspection Amory was quietly watching.
 
 “Don’t _you_ think so?” she said suddenly, turning to him,
 innocent-eyed.
 
 There was a stir, and Sally led the way over to their table.
 Amory struggled to Isabelle’s side, and whispered:
 
 “You’re my dinner partner, you know. We’re all coached for each
 other.”
 
 Isabelle gasped—this was rather right in line. But really she
 felt as if a good speech had been taken from the star and given
 to a minor character.... She mustn’t lose the leadership a bit.
 The dinner-table glittered with laughter at the confusion of
 getting places and then curious eyes were turned on her, sitting
 near the head. She was enjoying this immensely, and Froggy Parker
 was so engrossed with the added sparkle of her rising color that
 he forgot to pull out Sally’s chair, and fell into a dim
 confusion. Amory was on the other side, full of confidence and
 vanity, gazing at her in open admiration. He began directly, and
 so did Froggy:
 
 “I’ve heard a lot about you since you wore braids—”
 
 “Wasn’t it funny this afternoon—”
 
 Both stopped. Isabelle turned to Amory shyly. Her face was always
 enough answer for any one, but she decided to speak.
 
 “How—from whom?”
 
 “From everybody—for all the years since you’ve been away.” She
 blushed appropriately. On her right Froggy was _hors de combat_
 already, although he hadn’t quite realized it.
 
 “I’ll tell you what I remembered about you all these years,”
 Amory continued. She leaned slightly toward him and looked
 modestly at the celery before her. Froggy sighed—he knew Amory,
 and the situations that Amory seemed born to handle. He turned to
 Sally and asked her if she was going away to school next year.
 Amory opened with grape-shot.
 
 “I’ve got an adjective that just fits you.” This was one of his
 favorite starts—he seldom had a word in mind, but it was a
 curiosity provoker, and he could always produce something
 complimentary if he got in a tight corner.
 
 “Oh—what?” Isabelle’s face was a study in enraptured curiosity.
 
 Amory shook his head.
 
 “I don’t know you very well yet.”
 
 “Will you tell me—afterward?” she half whispered.
 
 He nodded.
 
 “We’ll sit out.”
 
 Isabelle nodded.
 
 “Did any one ever tell you, you have keen eyes?” she said.
 
 Amory attempted to make them look even keener. He fancied, but he
 was not sure, that her foot had just touched his under the table.
 But it might possibly have been only the table leg. It was so
 hard to tell. Still it thrilled him. He wondered quickly if there
 would be any difficulty in securing the little den up-stairs.
 
 
 BABES IN THE WOODS
 
 Isabelle and Amory were distinctly not innocent, nor were they
 particularly brazen. Moreover, amateur standing had very little
 value in the game they were playing, a game that would presumably
 be her principal study for years to come. She had begun as he
 had, with good looks and an excitable temperament, and the rest
 was the result of accessible popular novels and dressing-room
 conversation culled from a slightly older set. Isabelle had
 walked with an artificial gait at nine and a half, and when her
 eyes, wide and starry, proclaimed the ingenue most. Amory was
 proportionately less deceived. He waited for the mask to drop
 off, but at the same time he did not question her right to wear
 it. She, on her part, was not impressed by his studied air of
 blasé sophistication. She had lived in a larger city and had
 slightly an advantage in range. But she accepted his pose—it was
 one of the dozen little conventions of this kind of affair. He
 was aware that he was getting this particular favor now because
 she had been coached; he knew that he stood for merely the best
 game in sight, and that he would have to improve his opportunity
 before he lost his advantage. So they proceeded with an infinite
 guile that would have horrified her parents.
 
 After the dinner the dance began... smoothly. Smoothly?—boys cut
 in on Isabelle every few feet and then squabbled in the corners
 with: “You might let me get more than an inch!” and “She didn’t
 like it either—she told me so next time I cut in.” It was
 true—she told every one so, and gave every hand a parting
 pressure that said: “You know that your dances are _making_ my
 evening.”
 
 But time passed, two hours of it, and the less subtle beaux had
 better learned to focus their pseudo-passionate glances
 elsewhere, for eleven o’clock found Isabelle and Amory sitting on
 the couch in the little den off the reading-room up-stairs. She
 was conscious that they were a handsome pair, and seemed to
 belong distinctively in this seclusion, while lesser lights
 fluttered and chattered down-stairs.
 
 Boys who passed the door looked in enviously—girls who passed
 only laughed and frowned and grew wise within themselves.
 
 They had now reached a very definite stage. They had traded
 accounts of their progress since they had met last, and she had
 listened to much she had heard before. He was a sophomore, was on
 the Princetonian board, hoped to be chairman in senior year. He
 learned that some of the boys she went with in Baltimore were
 “terrible speeds” and came to dances in states of artificial
 stimulation; most of them were twenty or so, and drove alluring
 red Stutzes. A good half seemed to have already flunked out of
 various schools and colleges, but some of them bore athletic
 names that made him look at her admiringly. As a matter of fact,
 Isabelle’s closer acquaintance with the universities was just
 commencing. She had bowing acquaintance with a lot of young men
 who thought she was a “pretty kid—worth keeping an eye on.” But
 Isabelle strung the names into a fabrication of gayety that would
 have dazzled a Viennese nobleman. Such is the power of young
 contralto voices on sink-down sofas.
 
 He asked her if she thought he was conceited. She said there was
 a difference between conceit and self-confidence. She adored
 self-confidence in men.
 
 “Is Froggy a good friend of yours?” she asked.
 
 “Rather—why?”
 
 “He’s a bum dancer.”
 
 Amory laughed.
 
 “He dances as if the girl were on his back instead of in his
 arms.”
 
 She appreciated this.
 
 “You’re awfully good at sizing people up.”
 
 Amory denied this painfully. However, he sized up several people
 for her. Then they talked about hands.
 
 “You’ve got awfully nice hands,” she said. “They look as if you
 played the piano. Do you?”
 
 I have said they had reached a very definite stage—nay, more, a
 very critical stage. Amory had stayed over a day to see her, and
 his train left at twelve-eighteen that night. His trunk and
 suitcase awaited him at the station; his watch was beginning to
 hang heavy in his pocket.
 
 “Isabelle,” he said suddenly, “I want to tell you something.”
 They had been talking lightly about “that funny look in her
 eyes,” and Isabelle knew from the change in his manner what was
 coming—indeed, she had been wondering how soon it would come.
 Amory reached above their heads and turned out the electric
 light, so that they were in the dark, except for the red glow
 that fell through the door from the reading-room lamps. Then he
 began:
 
 “I don’t know whether or not you know what you—what I’m going to
 say. Lordy, Isabelle—this _sounds_ like a line, but it isn’t.”
 
 “I know,” said Isabelle softly.
 
 “Maybe we’ll never meet again like this—I have darned hard luck
 sometimes.” He was leaning away from her on the other arm of the
 lounge, but she could see his eyes plainly in the dark.
 
 “You’ll meet me again—silly.” There was just the slightest
 emphasis on the last word—so that it became almost a term of
 endearment. He continued a bit huskily:
 
 “I’ve fallen for a lot of people—girls—and I guess you have,
 too—boys, I mean, but, honestly, you—” he broke off suddenly and
 leaned forward, chin on his hands: “Oh, what’s the use—you’ll go
 your way and I suppose I’ll go mine.”
 
 Silence for a moment. Isabelle was quite stirred; she wound her
 handkerchief into a tight ball, and by the faint light that
 streamed over her, dropped it deliberately on the floor. Their
 hands touched for an instant, but neither spoke. Silences were
 becoming more frequent and more delicious. Outside another stray
 couple had come up and were experimenting on the piano in the
 next room. After the usual preliminary of “chopsticks,” one of
 them started “Babes in the Woods” and a light tenor carried the
 words into the den:
 
    “Give me your hand I’ll understand We’re off to slumberland.”
 
 Isabelle hummed it softly and trembled as she felt Amory’s hand
 close over hers.
 
 “Isabelle,” he whispered. “You know I’m mad about you. You _do_
 give a darn about me.”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “How much do you care—do you like any one better?”
 
 “No.” He could scarcely hear her, although he bent so near that
 he felt her breath against his cheek.
 
 “Isabelle, I’m going back to college for six long months, and why
 shouldn’t we—if I could only just have one thing to remember you
 by—”
 
 “Close the door....” Her voice had just stirred so that he half
 wondered whether she had spoken at all. As he swung the door
 softly shut, the music seemed quivering just outside.
 
    “Moonlight is bright, Kiss me good night.”
 
 What a wonderful song, she thought—everything was wonderful
 to-night, most of all this romantic scene in the den, with their
 hands clinging and the inevitable looming charmingly close. The
 future vista of her life seemed an unending succession of scenes
 like this: under moonlight and pale starlight, and in the backs
 of warm limousines and in low, cosy roadsters stopped under
 sheltering trees—only the boy might change, and this one was so
 nice. He took her hand softly. With a sudden movement he turned
 it and, holding it to his lips, kissed the palm.
 
 “Isabelle!” His whisper blended in the music, and they seemed to
 float nearer together. Her breath came faster. “Can’t I kiss you,
 Isabelle—Isabelle?” Lips half parted, she turned her head to him
 in the dark. Suddenly the ring of voices, the sound of running
 footsteps surged toward them. Quick as a flash Amory reached up
 and turned on the light, and when the door opened and three boys,
 the wrathy and dance-craving Froggy among them, rushed in, he was
 turning over the magazines on the table, while she sat without
 moving, serene and unembarrassed, and even greeted them with a
 welcoming smile. But her heart was beating wildly, and she felt
 somehow as if she had been deprived.
 
 It was evidently over. There was a clamor for a dance, there was
 a glance that passed between them—on his side despair, on hers
 regret, and then the evening went on, with the reassured beaux
 and the eternal cutting in.
 
 At quarter to twelve Amory shook hands with her gravely, in the
 midst of a small crowd assembled to wish him good-speed. For an
 instant he lost his poise, and she felt a bit rattled when a
 satirical voice from a concealed wit cried:
 
 “Take her outside, Amory!” As he took her hand he pressed it a
 little, and she returned the pressure as she had done to twenty
 hands that evening—that was all.
 
 At two o’clock back at the Weatherbys’ Sally asked her if she and
 Amory had had a “time” in the den. Isabelle turned to her
 quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate
 dreamer of Joan-like dreams.
 
 “No,” she answered. “I don’t do that sort of thing any more; he
 asked me to, but I said no.”
 
 As she crept in bed she wondered what he’d say in his special
 delivery to-morrow. He had such a good-looking mouth—would she
 ever—?
 
 “Fourteen angels were watching o’er them,” sang Sally sleepily
 from the next room.
 
 “Damn!” muttered Isabelle, punching the pillow into a luxurious
 lump and exploring the cold sheets cautiously. “Damn!”
 
 
 CARNIVAL
 
 Amory, by way of the Princetonian, had arrived. The minor snobs,
 finely balanced thermometers of success, warmed to him as the
 club elections grew nigh, and he and Tom were visited by groups
 of upper classmen who arrived awkwardly, balanced on the edge of
 the furniture and talked of all subjects except the one of
 absorbing interest. Amory was amused at the intent eyes upon him,
 and, in case the visitors represented some club in which he was
 not interested, took great pleasure in shocking them with
 unorthodox remarks.
 
 “Oh, let me see—” he said one night to a flabbergasted
 delegation, “what club do you represent?”
 
 With visitors from Ivy and Cottage and Tiger Inn he played the
 “nice, unspoilt, ingenuous boy” very much at ease and quite
 unaware of the object of the call.
 
 When the fatal morning arrived, early in March, and the campus
 became a document in hysteria, he slid smoothly into Cottage with
 Alec Connage and watched his suddenly neurotic class with much
 wonder.
 
 There were fickle groups that jumped from club to club; there
 were friends of two or three days who announced tearfully and
 wildly that they must join the same club, nothing should separate
 them; there were snarling disclosures of long-hidden grudges as
 the Suddenly Prominent remembered snubs of freshman year. Unknown
 men were elevated into importance when they received certain
 coveted bids; others who were considered “all set” found that
 they had made unexpected enemies, felt themselves stranded and
 deserted, talked wildly of leaving college.
 
 In his own crowd Amory saw men kept out for wearing green hats,
 for being “a damn tailor’s dummy,” for having “too much pull in
 heaven,” for getting drunk one night “not like a gentleman, by
 God,” or for unfathomable secret reasons known to no one but the
 wielders of the black balls.
 
 This orgy of sociability culminated in a gigantic party at the
 Nassau Inn, where punch was dispensed from immense bowls, and the
 whole down-stairs became a delirious, circulating, shouting
 pattern of faces and voices.
 
 “Hi, Dibby—’gratulations!”
 
 “Goo’ boy, Tom, you got a good bunch in Cap.”
 
 “Say, Kerry—”
 
 “Oh, Kerry—I hear you went Tiger with all the weight-lifters!”
 “Well, I didn’t go Cottage—the parlor-snakes’ delight.”
 
 “They say Overton fainted when he got his Ivy bid—Did he sign up
 the first day?—oh, _no_. Tore over to Murray-Dodge on a
 bicycle—afraid it was a mistake.”
 
 “How’d you get into Cap—you old roue?”
 
 “’Gratulations!”
 
 “’Gratulations yourself. Hear you got a good crowd.”
 
 When the bar closed, the party broke up into groups and streamed,
 singing, over the snow-clad campus, in a weird delusion that
 snobbishness and strain were over at last, and that they could do
 what they pleased for the next two years.
 
 Long afterward Amory thought of sophomore spring as the happiest
 time of his life. His ideas were in tune with life as he found
 it; he wanted no more than to drift and dream and enjoy a dozen
 new-found friendships through the April afternoons.
 
 Alec Connage came into his room one morning and woke him up into
 the sunshine and peculiar glory of Campbell Hall shining in the
 window.
 
 “Wake up, Original Sin, and scrape yourself together. Be in front
 of Renwick’s in half an hour. Somebody’s got a car.” He took the
 bureau cover and carefully deposited it, with its load of small
 articles, upon the bed.
 
 “Where’d you get the car?” demanded Amory cynically.
 
 “Sacred trust, but don’t be a critical goopher or you can’t go!”
 
 “I think I’ll sleep,” Amory said calmly, resettling himself and
 reaching beside the bed for a cigarette.
 
 “Sleep!”
 
 “Why not? I’ve got a class at eleven-thirty.”
 
 “You damned gloom! Of course, if you don’t want to go to the
 coast—”
 
 With a bound Amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau cover’s
 burden on the floor. The coast... he hadn’t seen it for years,
 since he and his mother were on their pilgrimage.
 
 “Who’s going?” he demanded as he wriggled into his B. V. D.’s.
 
 “Oh, Dick Humbird and Kerry Holiday and Jesse Ferrenby and—oh
 about five or six. Speed it up, kid!”
 
 In ten minutes Amory was devouring cornflakes in Renwick’s, and
 at nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the
 sands of Deal Beach.
 
 “You see,” said Kerry, “the car belongs down there. In fact, it
 was stolen from Asbury Park by persons unknown, who deserted it
 in Princeton and left for the West. Heartless Humbird here got
 permission from the city council to deliver it.”
 
 “Anybody got any money?” suggested Ferrenby, turning around from
 the front seat.
 
 There was an emphatic negative chorus.
 
 “That makes it interesting.”
 
 “Money—what’s money? We can sell the car.”
 
 “Charge him salvage or something.”
 
 “How’re we going to get food?” asked Amory.
 
 “Honestly,” answered Kerry, eying him reprovingly, “do you doubt
 Kerry’s ability for three short days? Some people have lived on
 nothing for years at a time. Read the Boy Scout Monthly.”
 
 “Three days,” Amory mused, “and I’ve got classes.”
 
 “One of the days is the Sabbath.”
 
 “Just the same, I can only cut six more classes, with over a
 month and a half to go.”
 
 “Throw him out!”
 
 “It’s a long walk back.”
 
 “Amory, you’re running it out, if I may coin a new phrase.”
 
 “Hadn’t you better get some dope on yourself, Amory?”
 
 Amory subsided resignedly and drooped into a contemplation of the
 scenery. Swinburne seemed to fit in somehow.
 
    “Oh, winter’s rains and ruins are over, And all the seasons of snows
    and sins; The days dividing lover and lover, The light that loses,
    the night that wins; And time remembered is grief forgotten, And
    frosts are slain and flowers begotten, And in green underwood and
    cover, Blossom by blossom the spring begins.
    “The full streams feed on flower of—”
 
 “What’s the matter, Amory? Amory’s thinking about poetry, about
 the pretty birds and flowers. I can see it in his eye.”
 
 “No, I’m not,” he lied. “I’m thinking about the Princetonian. I
 ought to make up to-night; but I can telephone back, I suppose.”
 
 “Oh,” said Kerry respectfully, “these important men—”
 
 Amory flushed and it seemed to him that Ferrenby, a defeated
 competitor, winced a little. Of course, Kerry was only kidding,
 but he really mustn’t mention the Princetonian.
 
 It was a halcyon day, and as they neared the shore and the salt
 breezes scurried by, he began to picture the ocean and long,
 level stretches of sand and red roofs over blue sea. Then they
 hurried through the little town and it all flashed upon his
 consciousness to a mighty paean of emotion....
 
 “Oh, good Lord! _Look_ at it!” he cried.
 
 “What?”
 
 “Let me out, quick—I haven’t seen it for eight years! Oh,
 gentlefolk, stop the car!”
 
 “What an odd child!” remarked Alec.
 
 “I do believe he’s a bit eccentric.”
 
 The car was obligingly drawn up at a curb, and Amory ran for the
 boardwalk. First, he realized that the sea was blue and that
 there was an enormous quantity of it, and that it roared and
 roared—really all the banalities about the ocean that one could
 realize, but if any one had told him then that these things were
 banalities, he would have gaped in wonder.
 
 “Now we’ll get lunch,” ordered Kerry, wandering up with the
 crowd. “Come on, Amory, tear yourself away and get practical.”
 
 “We’ll try the best hotel first,” he went on, “and thence and so
 forth.”
 
 They strolled along the boardwalk to the most imposing hostelry
 in sight, and, entering the dining-room, scattered about a table.
 
 “Eight Bronxes,” commanded Alec, “and a club sandwich and
 Juliennes. The food for one. Hand the rest around.”
 
 Amory ate little, having seized a chair where he could watch the
 sea and feel the rock of it. When luncheon was over they sat and
 smoked quietly.
 
 “What’s the bill?”
 
 Some one scanned it.
 
 “Eight twenty-five.”
 
 “Rotten overcharge. We’ll give them two dollars and one for the
 waiter. Kerry, collect the small change.”
 
 The waiter approached, and Kerry gravely handed him a dollar,
 tossed two dollars on the check, and turned away. They sauntered
 leisurely toward the door, pursued in a moment by the suspicious
 Ganymede.
 
 “Some mistake, sir.”
 
 Kerry took the bill and examined it critically.
 
 “No mistake!” he said, shaking his head gravely, and, tearing it
 into four pieces, he handed the scraps to the waiter, who was so
 dumfounded that he stood motionless and expressionless while they
 walked out.
 
 “Won’t he send after us?”
 
 “No,” said Kerry; “for a minute he’ll think we’re the
 proprietor’s sons or something; then he’ll look at the check
 again and call the manager, and in the meantime—”
 
 They left the car at Asbury and street-car’d to Allenhurst, where
 they investigated the crowded pavilions for beauty. At four there
 were refreshments in a lunch-room, and this time they paid an
 even smaller per cent on the total cost; something about the
 appearance and savoir-faire of the crowd made the thing go, and
 they were not pursued.
 
 “You see, Amory, we’re Marxian Socialists,” explained Kerry. “We
 don’t believe in property and we’re putting it to the great
 test.”
 
 “Night will descend,” Amory suggested.
 
 “Watch, and put your trust in Holiday.”
 
 They became jovial about five-thirty and, linking arms, strolled
 up and down the boardwalk in a row, chanting a monotonous ditty
 about the sad sea waves. Then Kerry saw a face in the crowd that
 attracted him and, rushing off, reappeared in a moment with one
 of the homeliest girls Amory had ever set eyes on. Her pale mouth
 extended from ear to ear, her teeth projected in a solid wedge,
 and she had little, squinty eyes that peeped ingratiatingly over
 the side sweep of her nose. Kerry presented them formally.
 
 “Name of Kaluka, Hawaiian queen! Let me present Messrs. Connage,
 Sloane, Humbird, Ferrenby, and Blaine.”
 
 The girl bobbed courtesies all around. Poor creature; Amory
 supposed she had never before been noticed in her life—possibly
 she was half-witted. While she accompanied them (Kerry had
 invited her to supper) she said nothing which could
 discountenance such a belief.
 
 “She prefers her native dishes,” said Alec gravely to the waiter,
 “but any coarse food will do.”
 
 All through supper he addressed her in the most respectful
 language, while Kerry made idiotic love to her on the other side,
 and she giggled and grinned. Amory was content to sit and watch
 the by-play, thinking what a light touch Kerry had, and how he
 could transform the barest incident into a thing of curve and
 contour. They all seemed to have the spirit of it more or less,
 and it was a relaxation to be with them. Amory usually liked men
 individually, yet feared them in crowds unless the crowd was
 around him. He wondered how much each one contributed to the
 party, for there was somewhat of a spiritual tax levied. Alec and
 Kerry were the life of it, but not quite the centre. Somehow the
 quiet Humbird, and Sloane, with his impatient superciliousness,
 were the centre.
 
 Dick Humbird had, ever since freshman year, seemed to Amory a
 perfect type of aristocrat. He was slender but well-built—black
 curly hair, straight features, and rather a dark skin. Everything
 he said sounded intangibly appropriate. He possessed infinite
 courage, an averagely good mind, and a sense of honor with a
 clear charm and _noblesse oblige_ that varied it from
 righteousness. He could dissipate without going to pieces, and
 even his most bohemian adventures never seemed “running it out.”
 People dressed like him, tried to talk as he did.... Amory
 decided that he probably held the world back, but he wouldn’t
 have changed him. ...
 
 He differed from the healthy type that was essentially middle
 class—he never seemed to perspire. Some people couldn’t be
 familiar with a chauffeur without having it returned; Humbird
 could have lunched at Sherry’s with a colored man, yet people
 would have somehow known that it was all right. He was not a
 snob, though he knew only half his class. His friends ranged from
 the highest to the lowest, but it was impossible to “cultivate”
 him. Servants worshipped him, and treated him like a god. He
 seemed the eternal example of what the upper class tries to be.
 
 “He’s like those pictures in the Illustrated London News of the
 English officers who have been killed,” Amory had said to Alec.
 “Well,” Alec had answered, “if you want to know the shocking
 truth, his father was a grocery clerk who made a fortune in
 Tacoma real estate and came to New York ten years ago.”
 
 Amory had felt a curious sinking sensation.
 
 This present type of party was made possible by the surging
 together of the class after club elections—as if to make a last
 desperate attempt to know itself, to keep together, to fight off
 the tightening spirit of the clubs. It was a let-down from the
 conventional heights they had all walked so rigidly.
 
 After supper they saw Kaluka to the boardwalk, and then strolled
 back along the beach to Asbury. The evening sea was a new
 sensation, for all its color and mellow age was gone, and it
 seemed the bleak waste that made the Norse sagas sad; Amory
 thought of Kipling’s
 
    “Beaches of Lukanon before the sealers came.”
 
 It was still a music, though, infinitely sorrowful.
 
 Ten o’clock found them penniless. They had suppered greatly on
 their last eleven cents and, singing, strolled up through the
 casinos and lighted arches on the boardwalk, stopping to listen
 approvingly to all band concerts. In one place Kerry took up a
 collection for the French War Orphans which netted a dollar and
 twenty cents, and with this they bought some brandy in case they
 caught cold in the night. They finished the day in a
 moving-picture show and went into solemn systematic roars of
 laughter at an ancient comedy, to the startled annoyance of the
 rest of the audience. Their entrance was distinctly strategic,
 for each man as he entered pointed reproachfully at the one just
 behind him. Sloane, bringing up the rear, disclaimed all
 knowledge and responsibility as soon as the others were scattered
 inside; then as the irate ticket-taker rushed in he followed
 nonchalantly.
 
 They reassembled later by the Casino and made arrangements for
 the night. Kerry wormed permission from the watchman to sleep on
 the platform and, having collected a huge pile of rugs from the
 booths to serve as mattresses and blankets, they talked until
 midnight, and then fell into a dreamless sleep, though Amory
 tried hard to stay awake and watch that marvellous moon settle on
 the sea.
 
 So they progressed for two happy days, up and down the shore by
 street-car or machine, or by shoe-leather on the crowded
 boardwalk; sometimes eating with the wealthy, more frequently
 dining frugally at the expense of an unsuspecting restaurateur.
 They had their photos taken, eight poses, in a quick-development
 store. Kerry insisted on grouping them as a “varsity” football
 team, and then as a tough gang from the East Side, with their
 coats inside out, and himself sitting in the middle on a
 cardboard moon. The photographer probably has them yet—at least,
 they never called for them. The weather was perfect, and again
 they slept outside, and again Amory fell unwillingly asleep.
 
 Sunday broke stolid and respectable, and even the sea seemed to
 mumble and complain, so they returned to Princeton via the Fords
 of transient farmers, and broke up with colds in their heads, but
 otherwise none the worse for wandering.
 
 Even more than in the year before, Amory neglected his work, not
 deliberately but lazily and through a multitude of other
 interests. Co-ordinate geometry and the melancholy hexameters of
 Corneille and Racine held forth small allurements, and even
 psychology, which he had eagerly awaited, proved to be a dull
 subject full of muscular reactions and biological phrases rather
 than the study of personality and influence. That was a noon
 class, and it always sent him dozing. Having found that
 “subjective and objective, sir,” answered most of the questions,
 he used the phrase on all occasions, and it became the class joke
 when, on a query being levelled at him, he was nudged awake by
 Ferrenby or Sloane to gasp it out.
 
 Mostly there were parties—to Orange or the Shore, more rarely to
 New York and Philadelphia, though one night they marshalled
 fourteen waitresses out of Childs’ and took them to ride down
 Fifth Avenue on top of an auto bus. They all cut more classes
 than were allowed, which meant an additional course the following
 year, but spring was too rare to let anything interfere with
 their colorful ramblings. In May Amory was elected to the
 Sophomore Prom Committee, and when after a long evening’s
 discussion with Alec they made out a tentative list of class
 probabilities for the senior council, they placed themselves
 among the surest. The senior council was composed presumably of
 the eighteen most representative seniors, and in view of Alec’s
 football managership and Amory’s chance of nosing out Burne
 Holiday as Princetonian chairman, they seemed fairly justified in
 this presumption. Oddly enough, they both placed D’Invilliers as
 among the possibilities, a guess that a year before the class
 would have gaped at.
 
 All through the spring Amory had kept up an intermittent
 correspondence with Isabelle Borge, punctuated by violent
 squabbles and chiefly enlivened by his attempts to find new words
 for love. He discovered Isabelle to be discreetly and
 aggravatingly unsentimental in letters, but he hoped against hope
 that she would prove not too exotic a bloom to fit the large
 spaces of spring as she had fitted the den in the Minnehaha Club.
 During May he wrote thirty-page documents almost nightly, and
 sent them to her in bulky envelopes exteriorly labelled “Part I”
 and “Part II.”
 
 “Oh, Alec, I believe I’m tired of college,” he said sadly, as
 they walked the dusk together.
 
 “I think I am, too, in a way.”
 
 “All I’d like would be a little home in the country, some warm
 country, and a wife, and just enough to do to keep from rotting.”
 
 “Me, too.”
 
 “I’d like to quit.”
 
 “What does your girl say?”
 
 “Oh!” Amory gasped in horror. “She wouldn’t _think_ of
 marrying... that is, not now. I mean the future, you know.”
 
 “My girl would. I’m engaged.”
 
 “Are you really?”
 
 “Yes. Don’t say a word to anybody, please, but I am. I may not
 come back next year.”
 
 “But you’re only twenty! Give up college?”
 
 “Why, Amory, you were saying a minute ago—”
 
 “Yes,” Amory interrupted, “but I was just wishing. I wouldn’t
 think of leaving college. It’s just that I feel so sad these
 wonderful nights. I sort of feel they’re never coming again, and
 I’m not really getting all I could out of them. I wish my girl
 lived here. But marry—not a chance. Especially as father says the
 money isn’t forthcoming as it used to be.”
 
 “What a waste these nights are!” agreed Alec.
 
 But Amory sighed and made use of the nights. He had a snap-shot
 of Isabelle, enshrined in an old watch, and at eight almost every
 night he would turn off all the lights except the desk lamp and,
 sitting by the open windows with the picture before him, write
 her rapturous letters.
 
  ... Oh it’s so hard to write you what I really _feel_ when I think
  about you so much; you’ve gotten to mean to me a _dream_ that I can’t
  put on paper any more.  Your last letter came and it was wonderful!  I
  read it over about six times, especially the last part, but I do wish,
  sometimes, you’d be more _frank_ and tell me what you really do think
  of me, yet your last letter was too good to be true, and I can hardly
  wait until June!  Be sure and be able to come to the prom.  It’ll be
  fine, I think, and I want to bring _you_ just at the end of a
  wonderful year.  I often think over what you said on that night and
  wonder how much you meant.  If it were anyone but you—but you see I
  _thought_ you were fickle the first time I saw you and you are so
  popular and everthing that I can’t imagine you really liking me
  _best_.
   Oh, Isabelle, dear—it’s a wonderful night.  Somebody is playing “Love
   Moon” on a mandolin far across the campus, and the music seems to
   bring you into the window.  Now he’s playing “Good-by, Boys, I’m
   Through,” and how well it suits me.  For I am through with
   everything.  I have decided never to take a cocktail again, and I
   know I’ll never again fall in love—I couldn’t—you’ve been too much a
   part of my days and nights to ever let me think of another girl.  I
   meet them all the time and they don’t interest me. I’m not pretending
   to be blasé, because it’s not that.  It’s just that I’m in love.  Oh,
   _dearest_ Isabelle (somehow I can’t call you just Isabelle, and I’m
   afraid I’ll come out with the “dearest” before your family this
   June), you’ve got to come to the prom, and then I’ll come up to your
   house for a day and everything’ll be perfect....
 
 And so on in an eternal monotone that seemed to both of them
 infinitely charming, infinitely new.
 
 
 June came and the days grew so hot and lazy that they could not
 worry even about exams, but spent dreamy evenings on the court of
 Cottage, talking of long subjects until the sweep of country
 toward Stony Brook became a blue haze and the lilacs were white
 around tennis-courts, and words gave way to silent cigarettes....
 Then down deserted Prospect and along McCosh with song everywhere
 around them, up to the hot joviality of Nassau Street.
 
 Tom D’Invilliers and Amory walked late in those days. A gambling
 fever swept through the sophomore class and they bent over the
 bones till three o’clock many a sultry night. After one session
 they came out of Sloane’s room to find the dew fallen and the
 stars old in the sky.
 
 “Let’s borrow bicycles and take a ride,” Amory suggested.
 
 “All right. I’m not a bit tired and this is almost the last night
 of the year, really, because the prom stuff starts Monday.”
 
 They found two unlocked bicycles in Holder Court and rode out
 about half-past three along the Lawrenceville Road.
 
 “What are you going to do this summer, Amory?”
 
 “Don’t ask me—same old things, I suppose. A month or two in Lake
 Geneva—I’m counting on you to be there in July, you know—then
 there’ll be Minneapolis, and that means hundreds of summer hops,
 parlor-snaking, getting bored—But oh, Tom,” he added suddenly,
 “hasn’t this year been slick!”
 
 “No,” declared Tom emphatically, a new Tom, clothed by Brooks,
 shod by Franks, “I’ve won this game, but I feel as if I never
 want to play another. You’re all right—you’re a rubber ball, and
 somehow it suits you, but I’m sick of adapting myself to the
 local snobbishness of this corner of the world. I want to go
 where people aren’t barred because of the color of their neckties
 and the roll of their coats.”
 
 “You can’t, Tom,” argued Amory, as they rolled along through the
 scattering night; “wherever you go now you’ll always
 unconsciously apply these standards of ‘having it’ or ‘lacking
 it.’ For better or worse we’ve stamped you; you’re a Princeton
 type!”
 
 “Well, then,” complained Tom, his cracked voice rising
 plaintively, “why do I have to come back at all? I’ve learned all
 that Princeton has to offer. Two years more of mere pedantry and
 lying around a club aren’t going to help. They’re just going to
 disorganize me, conventionalize me completely. Even now I’m so
 spineless that I wonder how I get away with it.”
 
 “Oh, but you’re missing the real point, Tom,” Amory interrupted.
 “You’ve just had your eyes opened to the snobbishness of the
 world in a rather abrupt manner. Princeton invariably gives the
 thoughtful man a social sense.”
 
 “You consider you taught me that, don’t you?” he asked
 quizzically, eying Amory in the half dark.
 
 Amory laughed quietly.
 
 “Didn’t I?”
 
 “Sometimes,” he said slowly, “I think you’re my bad angel. I
 might have been a pretty fair poet.”
 
 “Come on, that’s rather hard. You chose to come to an Eastern
 college. Either your eyes were opened to the mean scrambling
 quality of people, or you’d have gone through blind, and you’d
 hate to have done that—been like Marty Kaye.”
 
 “Yes,” he agreed, “you’re right. I wouldn’t have liked it. Still,
 it’s hard to be made a cynic at twenty.”
 
 “I was born one,” Amory murmured. “I’m a cynical idealist.” He
 paused and wondered if that meant anything.
 
 They reached the sleeping school of Lawrenceville, and turned to
 ride back.
 
 “It’s good, this ride, isn’t it?” Tom said presently.
 
 “Yes; it’s a good finish, it’s knock-out; everything’s good
 to-night. Oh, for a hot, languorous summer and Isabelle!”
 
 “Oh, you and your Isabelle! I’ll bet she’s a simple one... let’s
 say some poetry.”
 
 So Amory declaimed “The Ode to a Nightingale” to the bushes they
 passed.
 
 “I’ll never be a poet,” said Amory as he finished. “I’m not
 enough of a sensualist really; there are only a few obvious
 things that I notice as primarily beautiful: women, spring
 evenings, music at night, the sea; I don’t catch the subtle
 things like ‘silver-snarling trumpets.’ I may turn out an
 intellectual, but I’ll never write anything but mediocre poetry.”
 
 They rode into Princeton as the sun was making colored maps of
 the sky behind the graduate school, and hurried to the
 refreshment of a shower that would have to serve in place of
 sleep. By noon the bright-costumed alumni crowded the streets
 with their bands and choruses, and in the tents there was great
 reunion under the orange-and-black banners that curled and
 strained in the wind. Amory looked long at one house which bore
 the legend “Sixty-nine.” There a few gray-haired men sat and
 talked quietly while the classes swept by in panorama of life.
 
 
 UNDER THE ARC-LIGHT
 
 Then tragedy’s emerald eyes glared suddenly at Amory over the
 edge of June. On the night after his ride to Lawrenceville a
 crowd sallied to New York in quest of adventure, and started back
 to Princeton about twelve o’clock in two machines. It had been a
 gay party and different stages of sobriety were represented.
 Amory was in the car behind; they had taken the wrong road and
 lost the way, and so were hurrying to catch up.
 
 It was a clear night and the exhilaration of the road went to
 Amory’s head. He had the ghost of two stanzas of a poem forming
 in his mind. ...
 
   So the gray car crept nightward in the dark and there was no life
   stirred as it went by....  As the still ocean paths before the shark
   in starred and glittering waterways, beauty-high, the moon-swathed
   trees divided, pair on pair, while flapping nightbirds cried across
   the air....
   A moment by an inn of lamps and shades, a yellow inn under a yellow
   moon—then silence, where crescendo laughter fades... the car swung
   out again to the winds of June, mellowed the shadows where the
   distance grew, then crushed the yellow shadows into blue....
 
 They jolted to a stop, and Amory peered up, startled. A woman was
 standing beside the road, talking to Alec at the wheel. Afterward
 he remembered the harpy effect that her old kimono gave her, and
 the cracked hollowness of her voice as she spoke:
 
 “You Princeton boys?”
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Well, there’s one of you killed here, and two others about
 dead.”
 
 “_My God!_”
 
 “Look!” She pointed and they gazed in horror. Under the full
 light of a roadside arc-light lay a form, face downward in a
 widening circle of blood.
 
 They sprang from the car. Amory thought of the back of that
 head—that hair—that hair... and then they turned the form over.
 
 “It’s Dick—Dick Humbird!”
 
 “Oh, Christ!”
 
 “Feel his heart!”
 
 Then the insistent voice of the old crone in a sort of croaking
 triumph:
 
 “He’s quite dead, all right. The car turned over. Two of the men
 that weren’t hurt just carried the others in, but this one’s no
 use.”
 
 Amory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp
 mass that they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front
 parlor. Sloane, with his shoulder punctured, was on another
 lounge. He was half delirious, and kept calling something about a
 chemistry lecture at 8:10.
 
 “I don’t know what happened,” said Ferrenby in a strained voice.
 “Dick was driving and he wouldn’t give up the wheel; we told him
 he’d been drinking too much—then there was this damn curve—oh, my
 _God!_...” He threw himself face downward on the floor and broke
 into dry sobs.
 
 The doctor had arrived, and Amory went over to the couch, where
 some one handed him a sheet to put over the body. With a sudden
 hardness, he raised one of the hands and let it fall back
 inertly. The brow was cold but the face not expressionless. He
 looked at the shoe-laces—Dick had tied them that morning. _He_
 had tied them—and now he was this heavy white mass. All that
 remained of the charm and personality of the Dick Humbird he had
 known—oh, it was all so horrible and unaristocratic and close to
 the earth. All tragedy has that strain of the grotesque and
 squalid—so useless, futile... the way animals die.... Amory was
 reminded of a cat that had lain horribly mangled in some alley of
 his childhood.
 
 “Some one go to Princeton with Ferrenby.”
 
 Amory stepped outside the door and shivered slightly at the late
 night wind—a wind that stirred a broken fender on the mass of
 bent metal to a plaintive, tinny sound.
 
 
 CRESCENDO!
 
 Next day, by a merciful chance, passed in a whirl. When Amory was
 by himself his thoughts zigzagged inevitably to the picture of
 that red mouth yawning incongruously in the white face, but with
 a determined effort he piled present excitement upon the memory
 of it and shut it coldly away from his mind.
 
 Isabelle and her mother drove into town at four, and they rode up
 smiling Prospect Avenue, through the gay crowd, to have tea at
 Cottage. The clubs had their annual dinners that night, so at
 seven he loaned her to a freshman and arranged to meet her in the
 gymnasium at eleven, when the upper classmen were admitted to the
 freshman dance. She was all he had expected, and he was happy and
 eager to make that night the centre of every dream. At nine the
 upper classes stood in front of the clubs as the freshman
 torchlight parade rioted past, and Amory wondered if the
 dress-suited groups against the dark, stately backgrounds and
 under the flare of the torches made the night as brilliant to the
 staring, cheering freshmen as it had been to him the year before.
 
 The next day was another whirl. They lunched in a gay party of
 six in a private dining-room at the club, while Isabelle and
 Amory looked at each other tenderly over the fried chicken and
 knew that their love was to be eternal. They danced away the prom
 until five, and the stags cut in on Isabelle with joyous abandon,
 which grew more and more enthusiastic as the hour grew late, and
 their wines, stored in overcoat pockets in the coat room, made
 old weariness wait until another day. The stag line is a most
 homogeneous mass of men. It fairly sways with a single soul. A
 dark-haired beauty dances by and there is a half-gasping sound as
 the ripple surges forward and some one sleeker than the rest
 darts out and cuts in. Then when the six-foot girl (brought by
 Kaye in your class, and to whom he has been trying to introduce
 you all evening) gallops by, the line surges back and the groups
 face about and become intent on far corners of the hall, for
 Kaye, anxious and perspiring, appears elbowing through the crowd
 in search of familiar faces.
 
 “I say, old man, I’ve got an awfully nice—”
 
 “Sorry, Kaye, but I’m set for this one. I’ve got to cut in on a
 fella.”
 
 “Well, the next one?”
 
 “What—ah—er—I swear I’ve got to go cut in—look me up when she’s
 got a dance free.”
 
 It delighted Amory when Isabelle suggested that they leave for a
 while and drive around in her car. For a delicious hour that
 passed too soon they glided the silent roads about Princeton and
 talked from the surface of their hearts in shy excitement. Amory
 felt strangely ingenuous and made no attempt to kiss her.
 
 Next day they rode up through the Jersey country, had luncheon in
 New York, and in the afternoon went to see a problem play at
 which Isabelle wept all through the second act, rather to Amory’s
 embarrassment—though it filled him with tenderness to watch her.
 He was tempted to lean over and kiss away her tears, and she
 slipped her hand into his under cover of darkness to be pressed
 softly.
 
 Then at six they arrived at the Borges’ summer place on Long
 Island, and Amory rushed up-stairs to change into a dinner coat.
 As he put in his studs he realized that he was enjoying life as
 he would probably never enjoy it again. Everything was hallowed
 by the haze of his own youth. He had arrived, abreast of the best
 in his generation at Princeton. He was in love and his love was
 returned. Turning on all the lights, he looked at himself in the
 mirror, trying to find in his own face the qualities that made
 him see clearer than the great crowd of people, that made him
 decide firmly, and able to influence and follow his own will.
 There was little in his life now that he would have changed. ...
 Oxford might have been a bigger field.
 
 Silently he admired himself. How conveniently well he looked, and
 how well a dinner coat became him. He stepped into the hall and
 then waited at the top of the stairs, for he heard footsteps
 coming. It was Isabelle, and from the top of her shining hair to
 her little golden slippers she had never seemed so beautiful.
 
 “Isabelle!” he cried, half involuntarily, and held out his arms.
 As in the story-books, she ran into them, and on that
 half-minute, as their lips first touched, rested the high point
 of vanity, the crest of his young egotism.
 CHAPTER 3. The Egotist Considers
 
 
 “Ouch! Let me go!”
 
 He dropped his arms to his sides.
 
 “What’s the matter?”
 
 “Your shirt stud—it hurt me—look!” She was looking down at her
 neck, where a little blue spot about the size of a pea marred its
 pallor.
 
 “Oh, Isabelle,” he reproached himself, “I’m a goopher. Really,
 I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have held you so close.”
 
 She looked up impatiently.
 
 “Oh, Amory, of course you couldn’t help it, and it didn’t hurt
 much; but what _are_ we going to do about it?”
 
 “_Do_ about it?” he asked. “Oh—that spot; it’ll disappear in a
 second.”
 
 “It isn’t,” she said, after a moment of concentrated gazing,
 “it’s still there—and it looks like Old Nick—oh, Amory, what’ll
 we do! It’s _just_ the height of your shoulder.”
 
 “Massage it,” he suggested, repressing the faintest inclination
 to laugh.
 
 She rubbed it delicately with the tips of her fingers, and then a
 tear gathered in the corner of her eye, and slid down her cheek.
 
 “Oh, Amory,” she said despairingly, lifting up a most pathetic
 face, “I’ll just make my whole neck _flame_ if I rub it. What’ll
 I do?”
 
 A quotation sailed into his head and he couldn’t resist repeating
 it aloud.
 
   “All the perfumes of Arabia will not whiten this little hand.”
 
 She looked up and the sparkle of the tear in her eye was like
 ice.
 
 “You’re not very sympathetic.”
 
 Amory mistook her meaning.
 
 “Isabelle, darling, I think it’ll—”
 
 “Don’t touch me!” she cried. “Haven’t I enough on my mind and you
 stand there and _laugh!_”
 
 Then he slipped again.
 
 “Well, it _is_ funny, Isabelle, and we were talking the other day
 about a sense of humor being—”
 
 She was looking at him with something that was not a smile,
 rather the faint, mirthless echo of a smile, in the corners of
 her mouth.
 
 “Oh, shut up!” she cried suddenly, and fled down the hallway
 toward her room. Amory stood there, covered with remorseful
 confusion.
 
 “Damn!”
 
 When Isabelle reappeared she had thrown a light wrap about her
 shoulders, and they descended the stairs in a silence that
 endured through dinner.
 
 “Isabelle,” he began rather testily, as they arranged themselves
 in the car, bound for a dance at the Greenwich Country Club,
 “you’re angry, and I’ll be, too, in a minute. Let’s kiss and make
 up.”
 
 Isabelle considered glumly.
 
 “I hate to be laughed at,” she said finally.
 
 “I won’t laugh any more. I’m not laughing now, am I?”
 
 “You did.”
 
 “Oh, don’t be so darned feminine.”
 
 Her lips curled slightly.
 
 “I’ll be anything I want.”
 
 Amory kept his temper with difficulty. He became aware that he
 had not an ounce of real affection for Isabelle, but her coldness
 piqued him. He wanted to kiss her, kiss her a lot, because then
 he knew he could leave in the morning and not care. On the
 contrary, if he didn’t kiss her, it would worry him.... It would
 interfere vaguely with his idea of himself as a conqueror. It
 wasn’t dignified to come off second best, _pleading_, with a
 doughty warrior like Isabelle.
 
 Perhaps she suspected this. At any rate, Amory watched the night
 that should have been the consummation of romance glide by with
 great moths overhead and the heavy fragrance of roadside gardens,
 but without those broken words, those little sighs....
 
 Afterward they suppered on ginger ale and devil’s food in the
 pantry, and Amory announced a decision.
 
 “I’m leaving early in the morning.”
 
 “Why?”
 
 “Why not?” he countered.
 
 “There’s no need.”
 
 “However, I’m going.”
 
 “Well, if you insist on being ridiculous—”
 
 “Oh, don’t put it that way,” he objected.
 
 “—just because I won’t let you kiss me. Do you think—”
 
 “Now, Isabelle,” he interrupted, “you know it’s not that—even
 suppose it is. We’ve reached the stage where we either ought to
 kiss—or—or—nothing. It isn’t as if you were refusing on moral
 grounds.”
 
 She hesitated.
 
 “I really don’t know what to think about you,” she began, in a
 feeble, perverse attempt at conciliation. “You’re so funny.”
 
 “How?”
 
 “Well, I thought you had a lot of self-confidence and all that;
 remember you told me the other day that you could do anything you
 wanted, or get anything you wanted?”
 
 Amory flushed. He _had_ told her a lot of things.
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “Well, you didn’t seem to feel so self-confident to-night. Maybe
 you’re just plain conceited.”
 
 “No, I’m not,” he hesitated. “At Princeton—”
 
 “Oh, you and Princeton! You’d think that was the world, the way
 you talk! Perhaps you _can_ write better than anybody else on
 your old Princetonian; maybe the freshmen _do_ think you’re
 important—”
 
 “You don’t understand—”
 
 “Yes, I do,” she interrupted. “I _do_, because you’re always
 talking about yourself and I used to like it; now I don’t.”
 
 “Have I to-night?”
 
 “That’s just the point,” insisted Isabelle. “You got all upset
 to-night. You just sat and watched my eyes. Besides, I have to
 think all the time I’m talking to you—you’re so critical.”
 
 “I make you think, do I?” Amory repeated with a touch of vanity.
 
 “You’re a nervous strain”—this emphatically—“and when you analyze
 every little emotion and instinct I just don’t have ’em.”
 
 “I know.” Amory admitted her point and shook his head helplessly.
 
 “Let’s go.” She stood up.
 
 He rose abstractedly and they walked to the foot of the stairs.
 
 “What train can I get?”
 
 “There’s one about 9:11 if you really must go.”
 
 “Yes, I’ve got to go, really. Good night.”
 
 “Good night.”
 
 They were at the head of the stairs, and as Amory turned into his
 room he thought he caught just the faintest cloud of discontent
 in her face. He lay awake in the darkness and wondered how much
 he cared—how much of his sudden unhappiness was hurt
 vanity—whether he was, after all, temperamentally unfitted for
 romance.
 
 When he awoke, it was with a glad flood of consciousness. The
 early wind stirred the chintz curtains at the windows and he was
 idly puzzled not to be in his room at Princeton with his school
 football picture over the bureau and the Triangle Club on the
 wall opposite. Then the grandfather’s clock in the hall outside
 struck eight, and the memory of the night before came to him. He
 was out of bed, dressing, like the wind; he must get out of the
 house before he saw Isabelle. What had seemed a melancholy
 happening, now seemed a tiresome anticlimax. He was dressed at
 half past, so he sat down by the window; felt that the sinews of
 his heart were twisted somewhat more than he had thought. What an
 ironic mockery the morning seemed!—bright and sunny, and full of
 the smell of the garden; hearing Mrs. Borge’s voice in the
 sun-parlor below, he wondered where was Isabelle.
 
 There was a knock at the door.
 
 “The car will be around at ten minutes of nine, sir.”
 
 He returned to his contemplation of the outdoors, and began
 repeating over and over, mechanically, a verse from Browning,
 which he had once quoted to Isabelle in a letter:
 
    “Each life unfulfilled, you see, It hangs still, patchy and scrappy;
    We have not sighed deep, laughed free, Starved, feasted,
    despaired—been happy.”
 
 But his life would not be unfulfilled. He took a sombre
 satisfaction in thinking that perhaps all along she had been
 nothing except what he had read into her; that this was her high
 point, that no one else would ever make her think. Yet that was
 what she had objected to in him; and Amory was suddenly tired of
 thinking, thinking!
 
 “Damn her!” he said bitterly, “she’s spoiled my year!”
 
 
 THE SUPERMAN GROWS CARELESS
 
 On a dusty day in September Amory arrived in Princeton and joined
 the sweltering crowd of conditioned men who thronged the streets.
 It seemed a stupid way to commence his upper-class years, to
 spend four hours a morning in the stuffy room of a tutoring
 school, imbibing the infinite boredom of conic sections. Mr.
 Rooney, pander to the dull, conducted the class and smoked
 innumerable Pall Malls as he drew diagrams and worked equations
 from six in the morning until midnight.
 
 “Now, Langueduc, if I used that formula, where would my A point
 be?”
 
 Langueduc lazily shifts his six-foot-three of football material
 and tries to concentrate.
 
 “Oh—ah—I’m damned if I know, Mr. Rooney.”
 
 “Oh, why of course, of course you can’t _use_ that formula.
 _That’s_ what I wanted you to say.”
 
 “Why, sure, of course.”
 
 “Do you see why?”
 
 “You bet—I suppose so.”
 
 “If you don’t see, tell me. I’m here to show you.”
 
 “Well, Mr. Rooney, if you don’t mind, I wish you’d go over that
 again.”
 
 “Gladly. Now here’s ‘A’...”
 
 The room was a study in stupidity—two huge stands for paper, Mr.
 Rooney in his shirt-sleeves in front of them, and slouched around
 on chairs, a dozen men: Fred Sloane, the pitcher, who absolutely
 _had_ to get eligible; “Slim” Langueduc, who would beat Yale this
 fall, if only he could master a poor fifty per cent; McDowell,
 gay young sophomore, who thought it was quite a sporting thing to
 be tutoring here with all these prominent athletes.
 
 “Those poor birds who haven’t a cent to tutor, and have to study
 during the term are the ones I pity,” he announced to Amory one
 day, with a flaccid camaraderie in the droop of the cigarette
 from his pale lips. “I should think it would be such a bore,
 there’s so much else to do in New York during the term. I suppose
 they don’t know what they miss, anyhow.” There was such an air of
 “you and I” about Mr. McDowell that Amory very nearly pushed him
 out of the open window when he said this. ... Next February his
 mother would wonder why he didn’t make a club and increase his
 allowance... simple little nut....
 
 Through the smoke and the air of solemn, dense earnestness that
 filled the room would come the inevitable helpless cry:
 
 “I don’t get it! Repeat that, Mr. Rooney!” Most of them were so
 stupid or careless that they wouldn’t admit when they didn’t
 understand, and Amory was of the latter. He found it impossible
 to study conic sections; something in their calm and tantalizing
 respectability breathing defiantly through Mr. Rooney’s fetid
 parlors distorted their equations into insoluble anagrams. He
 made a last night’s effort with the proverbial wet towel, and
 then blissfully took the exam, wondering unhappily why all the
 color and ambition of the spring before had faded out. Somehow,
 with the defection of Isabelle the idea of undergraduate success
 had loosed its grasp on his imagination, and he contemplated a
 possible failure to pass off his condition with equanimity, even
 though it would arbitrarily mean his removal from the
 Princetonian board and the slaughter of his chances for the
 Senior Council.
 
 There was always his luck.
 
 He yawned, scribbled his honor pledge on the cover, and sauntered
 from the room.
 
 “If you don’t pass it,” said the newly arrived Alec as they sat
 on the window-seat of Amory’s room and mused upon a scheme of
 wall decoration, “you’re the world’s worst goopher. Your stock
 will go down like an elevator at the club and on the campus.”
 
 “Oh, hell, I know it. Why rub it in?”
 
 “’Cause you deserve it. Anybody that’d risk what you were in line
 for _ought_ to be ineligible for Princetonian chairman.”
 
 “Oh, drop the subject,” Amory protested. “Watch and wait and shut
 up. I don’t want every one at the club asking me about it, as if
 I were a prize potato being fattened for a vegetable show.” One
 evening a week later Amory stopped below his own window on the
 way to Renwick’s, and, seeing a light, called up:
 
 “Oh, Tom, any mail?”
 
 Alec’s head appeared against the yellow square of light.
 
 “Yes, your result’s here.”
 
 His heart clamored violently.
 
 “What is it, blue or pink?”
 
 “Don’t know. Better come up.”
 
 He walked into the room and straight over to the table, and then
 suddenly noticed that there were other people in the room.
 
 “’Lo, Kerry.” He was most polite. “Ah, men of Princeton.” They
 seemed to be mostly friends, so he picked up the envelope marked
 “Registrar’s Office,” and weighed it nervously.
 
 “We have here quite a slip of paper.”
 
 “Open it, Amory.”
 
 “Just to be dramatic, I’ll let you know that if it’s blue, my
 name is withdrawn from the editorial board of the Prince, and my
 short career is over.”
 
 He paused, and then saw for the first time Ferrenby’s eyes,
 wearing a hungry look and watching him eagerly. Amory returned
 the gaze pointedly.
 
 “Watch my face, gentlemen, for the primitive emotions.”
 
 He tore it open and held the slip up to the light.
 
 “Well?”
 
 “Pink or blue?”
 
 “Say what it is.”
 
 “We’re all ears, Amory.”
 
 “Smile or swear—or something.”
 
 There was a pause... a small crowd of seconds swept by... then he
 looked again and another crowd went on into time.
 
 “Blue as the sky, gentlemen....”
 
 
 AFTERMATH
 
 What Amory did that year from early September to late in the
 spring was so purposeless and inconsecutive that it seems
 scarcely worth recording. He was, of course, immediately sorry
 for what he had lost. His philosophy of success had tumbled down
 upon him, and he looked for the reasons.
 
 “Your own laziness,” said Alec later.
 
 “No—something deeper than that. I’ve begun to feel that I was
 meant to lose this chance.”
 
 “They’re rather off you at the club, you know; every man that
 doesn’t come through makes our crowd just so much weaker.”
 
 “I hate that point of view.”
 
 “Of course, with a little effort you could still stage a
 comeback.”
 
 “No—I’m through—as far as ever being a power in college is
 concerned.”
 
 “But, Amory, honestly, what makes me the angriest isn’t the fact
 that you won’t be chairman of the Prince and on the Senior
 Council, but just that you didn’t get down and pass that exam.”
 
 “Not me,” said Amory slowly; “I’m mad at the concrete thing. My
 own idleness was quite in accord with my system, but the luck
 broke.”
 
 “Your system broke, you mean.”
 
 “Maybe.”
 
 “Well, what are you going to do? Get a better one quick, or just
 bum around for two more years as a has-been?”
 
 “I don’t know yet...”
 
 “Oh, Amory, buck up!”
 
 “Maybe.”
 
 Amory’s point of view, though dangerous, was not far from the
 true one. If his reactions to his environment could be tabulated,
 the chart would have appeared like this, beginning with his
 earliest years:
 
  1. The fundamental Amory.
  2. Amory plus Beatrice.
  3. Amory plus Beatrice plus Minneapolis.
 
 Then St. Regis’ had pulled him to pieces and started him over
 again:
 
  4. Amory plus St. Regis’.
  5. Amory plus St. Regis’ plus Princeton.
 
 That had been his nearest approach to success through conformity.
 The fundamental Amory, idle, imaginative, rebellious, had been
 nearly snowed under. He had conformed, he had succeeded, but as
 his imagination was neither satisfied nor grasped by his own
 success, he had listlessly, half-accidentally chucked the whole
 thing and become again:
 
  6. The fundamental Amory.
 
 
 FINANCIAL
 
 His father died quietly and inconspicuously at Thanksgiving. The
 incongruity of death with either the beauties of Lake Geneva or
 with his mother’s dignified, reticent attitude diverted him, and
 he looked at the funeral with an amused tolerance. He decided
 that burial was after all preferable to cremation, and he smiled
 at his old boyhood choice, slow oxidation in the top of a tree.
 The day after the ceremony he was amusing himself in the great
 library by sinking back on a couch in graceful mortuary
 attitudes, trying to determine whether he would, when his day
 came, be found with his arms crossed piously over his chest
 (Monsignor Darcy had once advocated this posture as being the
 most distinguished), or with his hands clasped behind his head, a
 more pagan and Byronic attitude.
 
 What interested him much more than the final departure of his
 father from things mundane was a tri-cornered conversation
 between Beatrice, Mr. Barton, of Barton and Krogman, their
 lawyers, and himself, that took place several days after the
 funeral. For the first time he came into actual cognizance of the
 family finances, and realized what a tidy fortune had once been
 under his father’s management. He took a ledger labelled “1906”
 and ran through it rather carefully. The total expenditure that
 year had come to something over one hundred and ten thousand
 dollars. Forty thousand of this had been Beatrice’s own income,
 and there had been no attempt to account for it: it was all under
 the heading, “Drafts, checks, and letters of credit forwarded to
 Beatrice Blaine.” The dispersal of the rest was rather minutely
 itemized: the taxes and improvements on the Lake Geneva estate
 had come to almost nine thousand dollars; the general up-keep,
 including Beatrice’s electric and a French car, bought that year,
 was over thirty-five thousand dollars. The rest was fully taken
 care of, and there were invariably items which failed to balance
 on the right side of the ledger.
 
 In the volume for 1912 Amory was shocked to discover the decrease
 in the number of bond holdings and the great drop in the income.
 In the case of Beatrice’s money this was not so pronounced, but
 it was obvious that his father had devoted the previous year to
 several unfortunate gambles in oil. Very little of the oil had
 been burned, but Stephen Blaine had been rather badly singed. The
 next year and the next and the next showed similar decreases, and
 Beatrice had for the first time begun using her own money for
 keeping up the house. Yet her doctor’s bill for 1913 had been
 over nine thousand dollars.
 
 About the exact state of things Mr. Barton was quite vague and
 confused. There had been recent investments, the outcome of which
 was for the present problematical, and he had an idea there were
 further speculations and exchanges concerning which he had not
 been consulted.
 
 It was not for several months that Beatrice wrote Amory the full
 situation. The entire residue of the Blaine and O’Hara fortunes
 consisted of the place at Lake Geneva and approximately a half
 million dollars, invested now in fairly conservative six-per-cent
 holdings. In fact, Beatrice wrote that she was putting the money
 into railroad and street-car bonds as fast as she could
 conveniently transfer it.
 
   “I am quite sure,” she wrote to Amory, “that if there is one thing we
   can be positive of, it is that people will not stay in one place. 
   This Ford person has certainly made the most of that idea.  So I am
   instructing Mr. Barton to specialize on such things as Northern
   Pacific and these Rapid Transit Companies, as they call the
   street-cars.  I shall never forgive myself for not buying Bethlehem
   Steel.  I’ve heard the most fascinating stories.  You must go into
   finance, Amory.  I’m sure you would revel in it. You start as a
   messenger or a teller, I believe, and from that you go up—almost
   indefinitely.  I’m sure if I were a man I’d love the handling of
   money; it has become quite a senile passion with me. Before I get any
   farther I want to discuss something.  A Mrs. Bispam, an overcordial
   little lady whom I met at a tea the other day, told me that her son,
   he is at Yale, wrote her that all the boys there wore their summer
   underwear all during the winter, and also went about with their heads
   wet and in low shoes on the coldest days.  Now, Amory, I don’t know
   whether that is a fad at Princeton too, but I don’t want you to be so
   foolish.  It not only inclines a young man to pneumonia and infantile
   paralysis, but to all forms of lung trouble, to which you are
   particularly inclined.  You cannot experiment with your health.  I
   have found that out.  I will not make myself ridiculous as some
   mothers no doubt do, by insisting that you wear overshoes, though I
   remember one Christmas you wore them around constantly without a
   single buckle latched, making such a curious swishing sound, and you
   refused to buckle them because it was not the thing to do.  The very
   next Christmas you would not wear even rubbers, though I begged you. 
   You are nearly twenty years old now, dear, and I can’t be with you
   constantly to find whether you are doing the sensible thing.
   “This has been a very _practical_ letter.  I warned you in my last
   that the lack of money to do the things one wants to makes one quite
   prosy and domestic, but there is still plenty for everything if we
   are not too extravagant.  Take care of yourself, my dear boy, and do
   try to write at least _once_ a week, because I imagine all sorts of
   horrible things if I don’t hear from you. Affectionately,     
   MOTHER.”
 
 
 FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE TERM “PERSONAGE”
 
 Monsignor Darcy invited Amory up to the Stuart palace on the
 Hudson for a week at Christmas, and they had enormous
 conversations around the open fire. Monsignor was growing a
 trifle stouter and his personality had expanded even with that,
 and Amory felt both rest and security in sinking into a squat,
 cushioned chair and joining him in the middle-aged sanity of a
 cigar.
 
 “I’ve felt like leaving college, Monsignor.”
 
 “Why?”
 
 “All my career’s gone up in smoke; you think it’s petty and all
 that, but—”
 
 “Not at all petty. I think it’s most important. I want to hear
 the whole thing. Everything you’ve been doing since I saw you
 last.”
 
 Amory talked; he went thoroughly into the destruction of his
 egotistic highways, and in a half-hour the listless quality had
 left his voice.
 
 “What would you do if you left college?” asked Monsignor.
 
 “Don’t know. I’d like to travel, but of course this tiresome war
 prevents that. Anyways, mother would hate not having me graduate.
 I’m just at sea. Kerry Holiday wants me to go over with him and
 join the Lafayette Esquadrille.”
 
 “You know you wouldn’t like to go.”
 
 “Sometimes I would—to-night I’d go in a second.”
 
 “Well, you’d have to be very much more tired of life than I think
 you are. I know you.”
 
 “I’m afraid you do,” agreed Amory reluctantly. “It just seemed an
 easy way out of everything—when I think of another useless,
 draggy year.”
 
 “Yes, I know; but to tell you the truth, I’m not worried about
 you; you seem to me to be progressing perfectly naturally.”
 
 “No,” Amory objected. “I’ve lost half my personality in a year.”
 
 “Not a bit of it!” scoffed Monsignor. “You’ve lost a great amount
 of vanity and that’s all.”
 
 “Lordy! I feel, anyway, as if I’d gone through another fifth form
 at St. Regis’s.”
 
 “No.” Monsignor shook his head. “That was a misfortune; this has
 been a good thing. Whatever worth while comes to you, won’t be
 through the channels you were searching last year.”
 
 “What could be more unprofitable than my present lack of pep?”
 
 “Perhaps in itself... but you’re developing. This has given you
 time to think and you’re casting off a lot of your old luggage
 about success and the superman and all. People like us can’t
 adopt whole theories, as you did. If we can do the next thing,
 and have an hour a day to think in, we can accomplish marvels,
 but as far as any high-handed scheme of blind dominance is
 concerned—we’d just make asses of ourselves.”
 
 “But, Monsignor, I can’t do the next thing.”
 
 “Amory, between you and me, I have only just learned to do it
 myself. I can do the one hundred things beyond the next thing,
 but I stub my toe on that, just as you stubbed your toe on
 mathematics this fall.”
 
 “Why do we have to do the next thing? It never seems the sort of
 thing I should do.”
 
 “We have to do it because we’re not personalities, but
 personages.”
 
 “That’s a good line—what do you mean?”
 
 “A personality is what you thought you were, what this Kerry and
 Sloane you tell me of evidently are. Personality is a physical
 matter almost entirely; it lowers the people it acts on—I’ve seen
 it vanish in a long sickness. But while a personality is active,
 it overrides ‘the next thing.’ Now a personage, on the other
 hand, gathers. He is never thought of apart from what he’s done.
 He’s a bar on which a thousand things have been hung—glittering
 things sometimes, as ours are; but he uses those things with a
 cold mentality back of them.”
 
 “And several of my most glittering possessions had fallen off
 when I needed them.” Amory continued the simile eagerly.
 
 “Yes, that’s it; when you feel that your garnered prestige and
 talents and all that are hung out, you need never bother about
 anybody; you can cope with them without difficulty.”
 
 “But, on the other hand, if I haven’t my possessions, I’m
 helpless!”
 
 “Absolutely.”
 
 “That’s certainly an idea.”
 
 “Now you’ve a clean start—a start Kerry or Sloane can
 constitutionally never have. You brushed three or four ornaments
 down, and, in a fit of pique, knocked off the rest of them. The
 thing now is to collect some new ones, and the farther you look
 ahead in the collecting the better. But remember, do the next
 thing!”
 
 “How clear you can make things!”
 
 So they talked, often about themselves, sometimes of philosophy
 and religion, and life as respectively a game or a mystery. The
 priest seemed to guess Amory’s thoughts before they were clear in
 his own head, so closely related were their minds in form and
 groove.
 
 “Why do I make lists?” Amory asked him one night. “Lists of all
 sorts of things?”
 
 “Because you’re a mediaevalist,” Monsignor answered. “We both
 are. It’s the passion for classifying and finding a type.”
 
 “It’s a desire to get something definite.”
 
 “It’s the nucleus of scholastic philosophy.”
 
 “I was beginning to think I was growing eccentric till I came up
 here. It was a pose, I guess.”
 
 “Don’t worry about that; for you not posing may be the biggest
 pose of all. Pose—”
 
 “Yes?”
 
 “But do the next thing.”
 
 After Amory returned to college he received several letters from
 Monsignor which gave him more egotistic food for consumption.
 
   I am afraid that I gave you too much assurance of your inevitable
   safety, and you must remember that I did that through faith in your
   springs of effort; not in the silly conviction that you will arrive
   without struggle.  Some nuances of character you will have to take
   for granted in yourself, though you must be careful in confessing
   them to others.  You are unsentimental, almost incapable of
   affection, astute without being cunning and vain without being proud.
   Don’t let yourself feel worthless; often through life you will really
   be at your worst when you seem to think best of yourself; and don’t
   worry about losing your “personality,” as you persist in calling it;
   at fifteen you had the radiance of early morning, at twenty you will
   begin to have the melancholy brilliance of the moon, and when you are
   my age you will give out, as I do, the genial golden warmth of 4 P.M.
   If you write me letters, please let them be natural ones.  Your last,
   that dissertation on architecture, was perfectly awful— so “highbrow”
   that I picture you living in an intellectual and emotional vacuum;
   and beware of trying to classify people too definitely into types;
   you will find that all through their youth they will persist
   annoyingly in jumping from class to class, and by pasting a
   supercilious label on every one you meet you are merely packing a
   Jack-in-the-box that will spring up and leer at you when you begin to
   come into really antagonistic contact with the world.  An
   idealization of some such a man as Leonardo da Vinci would be a more
   valuable beacon to you at present.
   You are bound to go up and down, just as I did in my youth, but do
   keep your clarity of mind, and if fools or sages dare to criticise
   don’t blame yourself too much.
   You say that convention is all that really keeps you straight in this
   “woman proposition”; but it’s more than that, Amory; it’s the fear
   that what you begin you can’t stop; you would run amuck, and I know
   whereof I speak; it’s that half-miraculous sixth sense by which you
   detect evil, it’s the half-realized fear of God in your heart.
   Whatever your metier proves to be—religion, architecture,
   literature—I’m sure you would be much safer anchored to the Church,
   but I won’t risk my influence by arguing with you even though I am
   secretly sure that the “black chasm of Romanism” yawns beneath you. 
   Do write me soon.
     With affectionate regards,    THAYER DARCY.
 
 Even Amory’s reading paled during this period; he delved further
 into the misty side streets of literature: Huysmans, Walter
 Pater, Theophile Gautier, and the racier sections of Rabelais,
 Boccaccio, Petronius, and Suetonius. One week, through general
 curiosity, he inspected the private libraries of his classmates
 and found Sloane’s as typical as any: sets of Kipling, O. Henry,
 John Fox, Jr., and Richard Harding Davis; “What Every Middle-Aged
 Woman Ought to Know,” “The Spell of the Yukon”; a “gift” copy of
 James Whitcomb Riley, an assortment of battered, annotated
 schoolbooks, and, finally, to his surprise, one of his own late
 discoveries, the collected poems of Rupert Brooke.
 
 Together with Tom D’Invilliers, he sought among the lights of
 Princeton for some one who might found the Great American Poetic
 Tradition.
 
 The undergraduate body itself was rather more interesting that
 year than had been the entirely Philistine Princeton of two years
 before. Things had livened surprisingly, though at the sacrifice
 of much of the spontaneous charm of freshman year. In the old
 Princeton they would never have discovered Tanaduke Wylie.
 Tanaduke was a sophomore, with tremendous ears and a way of
 saying, “The earth swirls down through the ominous moons of
 preconsidered generations!” that made them vaguely wonder why it
 did not sound quite clear, but never question that it was the
 utterance of a supersoul. At least so Tom and Amory took him.
 They told him in all earnestness that he had a mind like
 Shelley’s, and featured his ultrafree free verse and prose poetry
 in the Nassau Literary Magazine. But Tanaduke’s genius absorbed
 the many colors of the age, and he took to the Bohemian life, to
 their great disappointment. He talked of Greenwich Village now
 instead of “noon-swirled moons,” and met winter muses,
 unacademic, and cloistered by Forty-second Street and Broadway,
 instead of the Shelleyan dream-children with whom he had regaled
 their expectant appreciation. So they surrendered Tanaduke to the
 futurists, deciding that he and his flaming ties would do better
 there. Tom gave him the final advice that he should stop writing
 for two years and read the complete works of Alexander Pope four
 times, but on Amory’s suggestion that Pope for Tanaduke was like
 foot-ease for stomach trouble, they withdrew in laughter, and
 called it a coin’s toss whether this genius was too big or too
 petty for them.
 
 Amory rather scornfully avoided the popular professors who
 dispensed easy epigrams and thimblefuls of Chartreuse to groups
 of admirers every night. He was disappointed, too, at the air of
 general uncertainty on every subject that seemed linked with the
 pedantic temperament; his opinions took shape in a miniature
 satire called “In a Lecture-Room,” which he persuaded Tom to
 print in the Nassau Lit.
 
    “Good-morning, Fool... Three times a week You hold us helpless while
    you speak, Teasing our thirsty souls with the Sleek ‘yeas’ of your
    philosophy... Well, here we are, your hundred sheep, Tune up, play
    on, pour forth... we sleep... You are a student, so they say; You
    hammered out the other day A syllabus, from what we know Of some
    forgotten folio; You’d sniffled through an era’s must, Filling your
    nostrils up with dust, And then, arising from your knees, Published,
    in one gigantic sneeze... But here’s a neighbor on my right, An
    Eager Ass, considered bright; Asker of questions....  How he’ll
    stand, With earnest air and fidgy hand, After this hour, telling you
    He sat all night and burrowed through Your book....  Oh, you’ll be
    coy and he Will simulate precosity, And pedants both, you’ll smile
    and smirk, And leer, and hasten back to work....
     ’Twas this day week, sir, you returned A theme of mine, from which
     I learned (Through various comment on the side Which you had
     scrawled) that I defied The _highest rules of criticism_ For
     _cheap_ and _careless_ witticism.... ‘Are you quite sure that this
     could be?’ And ‘Shaw is no authority!’ But Eager Ass, with what
     he’s sent, Plays havoc with your best per cent.
     Still—still I meet you here and there... When Shakespeare’s played
     you hold a chair, And some defunct, moth-eaten star Enchants the
     mental prig you are... A radical comes down and shocks The
     atheistic orthodox? You’re representing Common Sense, Mouth open,
     in the audience. And, sometimes, even chapel lures That conscious
     tolerance of yours, That broad and beaming view of truth (Including
     Kant and General Booth...) And so from shock to shock you live, A
     hollow, pale affirmative...
     The hour’s up... and roused from rest One hundred children of the
     blest Cheat you a word or two with feet That down the noisy
     aisle-ways beat... Forget on _narrow-minded earth_ The Mighty Yawn
     that gave you birth.”
 
 In April, Kerry Holiday left college and sailed for France to
 enroll in the Lafayette Esquadrille. Amory’s envy and admiration
 of this step was drowned in an experience of his own to which he
 never succeeded in giving an appropriate value, but which,
 nevertheless, haunted him for three years afterward.
 
 
 THE DEVIL
 
 Healy’s they left at twelve and taxied to Bistolary’s. There were
 Axia Marlowe and Phoebe Column, from the Summer Garden show, Fred
 Sloane and Amory. The evening was so very young that they felt
 ridiculous with surplus energy, and burst into the cafe like
 Dionysian revellers.
 
 “Table for four in the middle of the floor,” yelled Phoebe.
 “Hurry, old dear, tell ’em we’re here!”
 
 “Tell ’em to play ‘Admiration’!” shouted Sloane. “You two order;
 Phoebe and I are going to shake a wicked calf,” and they sailed
 off in the muddled crowd. Axia and Amory, acquaintances of an
 hour, jostled behind a waiter to a table at a point of vantage;
 there they took seats and watched.
 
 “There’s Findle Margotson, from New Haven!” she cried above the
 uproar. “’Lo, Findle! Whoo-ee!”
 
 “Oh, Axia!” he shouted in salutation. “C’mon over to our table.”
 “No!” Amory whispered.
 
 “Can’t do it, Findle; I’m with somebody else! Call me up
 to-morrow about one o’clock!”
 
 Findle, a nondescript man-about-Bisty’s, answered incoherently
 and turned back to the brilliant blonde whom he was endeavoring
 to steer around the room.
 
 “There’s a natural damn fool,” commented Amory.
 
 “Oh, he’s all right. Here’s the old jitney waiter. If you ask me,
 I want a double Daiquiri.”
 
 “Make it four.”
 
 The crowd whirled and changed and shifted. They were mostly from
 the colleges, with a scattering of the male refuse of Broadway,
 and women of two types, the higher of which was the chorus girl.
 On the whole it was a typical crowd, and their party as typical
 as any. About three-fourths of the whole business was for effect
 and therefore harmless, ended at the door of the cafe, soon
 enough for the five-o’clock train back to Yale or Princeton;
 about one-fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered
 strange dust from strange places. Their party was scheduled to be
 one of the harmless kind. Fred Sloane and Phoebe Column were old
 friends; Axia and Amory new ones. But strange things are prepared
 even in the dead of night, and the unusual, which lurks least in
 the cafe, home of the prosaic and inevitable, was preparing to
 spoil for him the waning romance of Broadway. The way it took was
 so inexpressibly terrible, so unbelievable, that afterward he
 never thought of it as experience; but it was a scene from a
 misty tragedy, played far behind the veil, and that it meant
 something definite he knew.
 
 About one o’clock they moved to Maxim’s, and two found them in
 Deviniere’s. Sloane had been drinking consecutively and was in a
 state of unsteady exhilaration, but Amory was quite tiresomely
 sober; they had run across none of those ancient, corrupt buyers
 of champagne who usually assisted their New York parties. They
 were just through dancing and were making their way back to their
 chairs when Amory became aware that some one at a near-by table
 was looking at him. He turned and glanced casually... a
 middle-aged man dressed in a brown sack suit, it was, sitting a
 little apart at a table by himself and watching their party
 intently. At Amory’s glance he smiled faintly. Amory turned to
 Fred, who was just sitting down.
 
 “Who’s that pale fool watching us?” he complained indignantly.
 
 “Where?” cried Sloane. “We’ll have him thrown out!” He rose to
 his feet and swayed back and forth, clinging to his chair. “Where
 is he?”
 
 Axia and Phoebe suddenly leaned and whispered to each other
 across the table, and before Amory realized it they found
 themselves on their way to the door.
 
 “Where now?”
 
 “Up to the flat,” suggested Phoebe. “We’ve got brandy and
 fizz—and everything’s slow down here to-night.”
 
 Amory considered quickly. He hadn’t been drinking, and decided
 that if he took no more, it would be reasonably discreet for him
 to trot along in the party. In fact, it would be, perhaps, the
 thing to do in order to keep an eye on Sloane, who was not in a
 state to do his own thinking. So he took Axia’s arm and, piling
 intimately into a taxicab, they drove out over the hundreds and
 drew up at a tall, white-stone apartment-house. ... Never would
 he forget that street.... It was a broad street, lined on both
 sides with just such tall, white-stone buildings, dotted with
 dark windows; they stretched along as far as the eye could see,
 flooded with a bright moonlight that gave them a calcium pallor.
 He imagined each one to have an elevator and a colored hall-boy
 and a key-rack; each one to be eight stories high and full of
 three and four room suites. He was rather glad to walk into the
 cheeriness of Phoebe’s living-room and sink onto a sofa, while
 the girls went rummaging for food.
 
 “Phoebe’s great stuff,” confided Sloane, sotto voce.
 
 “I’m only going to stay half an hour,” Amory said sternly. He
 wondered if it sounded priggish.
 
 “Hell y’ say,” protested Sloane. “We’re here now—don’t le’s
 rush.”
 
 “I don’t like this place,” Amory said sulkily, “and I don’t want
 any food.”
 
 Phoebe reappeared with sandwiches, brandy bottle, siphon, and
 four glasses.
 
 “Amory, pour ’em out,” she said, “and we’ll drink to Fred Sloane,
 who has a rare, distinguished edge.”
 
 “Yes,” said Axia, coming in, “and Amory. I like Amory.” She sat
 down beside him and laid her yellow head on his shoulder.
 
 “I’ll pour,” said Sloane; “you use siphon, Phoebe.”
 
 They filled the tray with glasses.
 
 “Ready, here she goes!”
 
 Amory hesitated, glass in hand.
 
 There was a minute while temptation crept over him like a warm
 wind, and his imagination turned to fire, and he took the glass
 from Phoebe’s hand. That was all; for at the second that his
 decision came, he looked up and saw, ten yards from him, the man
 who had been in the cafe, and with his jump of astonishment the
 glass fell from his uplifted hand. There the man half sat, half
 leaned against a pile of pillows on the corner divan. His face
 was cast in the same yellow wax as in the cafe, neither the dull,
 pasty color of a dead man—rather a sort of virile pallor—nor
 unhealthy, you’d have called it; but like a strong man who’d
 worked in a mine or done night shifts in a damp climate. Amory
 looked him over carefully and later he could have drawn him after
 a fashion, down to the merest details. His mouth was the kind
 that is called frank, and he had steady gray eyes that moved
 slowly from one to the other of their group, with just the shade
 of a questioning expression. Amory noticed his hands; they
 weren’t fine at all, but they had versatility and a tenuous
 strength... they were nervous hands that sat lightly along the
 cushions and moved constantly with little jerky openings and
 closings. Then, suddenly, Amory perceived the feet, and with a
 rush of blood to the head he realized he was afraid. The feet
 were all wrong ... with a sort of wrongness that he felt rather
 than knew.... It was like weakness in a good woman, or blood on
 satin; one of those terrible incongruities that shake little
 things in the back of the brain. He wore no shoes, but, instead,
 a sort of half moccasin, pointed, though, like the shoes they
 wore in the fourteenth century, and with the little ends curling
 up. They were a darkish brown and his toes seemed to fill them to
 the end.... They were unutterably terrible....
 
 He must have said something, or looked something, for Axia’s
 voice came out of the void with a strange goodness.
 
 “Well, look at Amory! Poor old Amory’s sick—old head going
 ’round?”
 
 “Look at that man!” cried Amory, pointing toward the corner
 divan.
 
 “You mean that purple zebra!” shrieked Axia facetiously. “Ooo-ee!
 Amory’s got a purple zebra watching him!”
 
 Sloane laughed vacantly.
 
 “Ole zebra gotcha, Amory?”
 
 There was a silence.... The man regarded Amory quizzically....
 Then the human voices fell faintly on his ear:
 
 “Thought you weren’t drinking,” remarked Axia sardonically, but
 her voice was good to hear; the whole divan that held the man was
 alive; alive like heat waves over asphalt, like wriggling
 worms....
 
 “Come back! Come back!” Axia’s arm fell on his. “Amory, dear, you
 aren’t going, Amory!” He was half-way to the door.
 
 “Come on, Amory, stick ’th us!”
 
 “Sick, are you?”
 
 “Sit down a second!”
 
 “Take some water.”
 
 “Take a little brandy....”
 
 The elevator was close, and the colored boy was half asleep,
 paled to a livid bronze... Axia’s beseeching voice floated down
 the shaft. Those feet... those feet...
 
 As they settled to the lower floor the feet came into view in the
 sickly electric light of the paved hall.
 
 
 IN THE ALLEY
 
 Down the long street came the moon, and Amory turned his back on
 it and walked. Ten, fifteen steps away sounded the footsteps.
 They were like a slow dripping, with just the slightest
 insistence in their fall. Amory’s shadow lay, perhaps, ten feet
 ahead of him, and soft shoes was presumably that far behind. With
 the instinct of a child Amory edged in under the blue darkness of
 the white buildings, cleaving the moonlight for haggard seconds,
 once bursting into a slow run with clumsy stumblings. After that
 he stopped suddenly; he must keep hold, he thought. His lips were
 dry and he licked them.
 
 If he met any one good—were there any good people left in the
 world or did they all live in white apartment-houses now? Was
 every one followed in the moonlight? But if he met some one good
 who’d know what he meant and hear this damned scuffle... then the
 scuffling grew suddenly nearer, and a black cloud settled over
 the moon. When again the pale sheen skimmed the cornices, it was
 almost beside him, and Amory thought he heard a quiet breathing.
 Suddenly he realized that the footsteps were not behind, had
 never been behind, they were ahead and he was not eluding but
 following... following. He began to run, blindly, his heart
 knocking heavily, his hands clinched. Far ahead a black dot
 showed itself, resolved slowly into a human shape. But Amory was
 beyond that now; he turned off the street and darted into an
 alley, narrow and dark and smelling of old rottenness. He twisted
 down a long, sinuous blackness, where the moonlight was shut away
 except for tiny glints and patches... then suddenly sank panting
 into a corner by a fence, exhausted. The steps ahead stopped, and
 he could hear them shift slightly with a continuous motion, like
 waves around a dock.
 
 He put his face in his hands and covered eyes and ears as well as
 he could. During all this time it never occurred to him that he
 was delirious or drunk. He had a sense of reality such as
 material things could never give him. His intellectual content
 seemed to submit passively to it, and it fitted like a glove
 everything that had ever preceded it in his life. It did not
 muddle him. It was like a problem whose answer he knew on paper,
 yet whose solution he was unable to grasp. He was far beyond
 horror. He had sunk through the thin surface of that, now moved
 in a region where the feet and the fear of white walls were real,
 living things, things he must accept. Only far inside his soul a
 little fire leaped and cried that something was pulling him down,
 trying to get him inside a door and slam it behind him. After
 that door was slammed there would be only footfalls and white
 buildings in the moonlight, and perhaps he would be one of the
 footfalls.
 
 During the five or ten minutes he waited in the shadow of the
 fence, there was somehow this fire... that was as near as he
 could name it afterward. He remembered calling aloud:
 
 “I want some one stupid. Oh, send some one stupid!” This to the
 black fence opposite him, in whose shadows the footsteps shuffled
 ... shuffled. He supposed “stupid” and “good” had become somehow
 intermingled through previous association. When he called thus it
 was not an act of will at all—will had turned him away from the
 moving figure in the street; it was almost instinct that called,
 just the pile on pile of inherent tradition or some wild prayer
 from way over the night. Then something clanged like a low gong
 struck at a distance, and before his eyes a face flashed over the
 two feet, a face pale and distorted with a sort of infinite evil
 that twisted it like flame in the wind; _but he knew, for the
 half instant that the gong tanged and hummed, that it was the
 face of Dick Humbird._
 
 Minutes later he sprang to his feet, realizing dimly that there
 was no more sound, and that he was alone in the graying alley. It
 was cold, and he started on a steady run for the light that
 showed the street at the other end.
 
 
 AT THE WINDOW
 
 It was late morning when he woke and found the telephone beside
 his bed in the hotel tolling frantically, and remembered that he
 had left word to be called at eleven. Sloane was snoring heavily,
 his clothes in a pile by his bed. They dressed and ate breakfast
 in silence, and then sauntered out to get some air. Amory’s mind
 was working slowly, trying to assimilate what had happened and
 separate from the chaotic imagery that stacked his memory the
 bare shreds of truth. If the morning had been cold and gray he
 could have grasped the reins of the past in an instant, but it
 was one of those days that New York gets sometimes in May, when
 the air on Fifth Avenue is a soft, light wine. How much or how
 little Sloane remembered Amory did not care to know; he
 apparently had none of the nervous tension that was gripping
 Amory and forcing his mind back and forth like a shrieking saw.
 
 Then Broadway broke upon them, and with the babel of noise and
 the painted faces a sudden sickness rushed over Amory.
 
 “For God’s sake, let’s go back! Let’s get off of this—this
 place!”
 
 Sloane looked at him in amazement.
 
 “What do you mean?”
 
 “This street, it’s ghastly! Come on! let’s get back to the
 Avenue!”
 
 “Do you mean to say,” said Sloane stolidly, “that ’cause you had
 some sort of indigestion that made you act like a maniac last
 night, you’re never coming on Broadway again?”
 
 Simultaneously Amory classed him with the crowd, and he seemed no
 longer Sloane of the debonair humor and the happy personality,
 but only one of the evil faces that whirled along the turbid
 stream.
 
 “Man!” he shouted so loud that the people on the corner turned
 and followed them with their eyes, “it’s filthy, and if you can’t
 see it, you’re filthy, too!”
 
 “I can’t help it,” said Sloane doggedly. “What’s the matter with
 you? Old remorse getting you? You’d be in a fine state if you’d
 gone through with our little party.”
 
 “I’m going, Fred,” said Amory slowly. His knees were shaking
 under him, and he knew that if he stayed another minute on this
 street he would keel over where he stood. “I’ll be at the
 Vanderbilt for lunch.” And he strode rapidly off and turned over
 to Fifth Avenue. Back at the hotel he felt better, but as he
 walked into the barber-shop, intending to get a head massage, the
 smell of the powders and tonics brought back Axia’s sidelong,
 suggestive smile, and he left hurriedly. In the doorway of his
 room a sudden blackness flowed around him like a divided river.
 
 When he came to himself he knew that several hours had passed. He
 pitched onto the bed and rolled over on his face with a deadly
 fear that he was going mad. He wanted people, people, some one
 sane and stupid and good. He lay for he knew not how long without
 moving. He could feel the little hot veins on his forehead
 standing out, and his terror had hardened on him like plaster. He
 felt he was passing up again through the thin crust of horror,
 and now only could he distinguish the shadowy twilight he was
 leaving. He must have fallen asleep again, for when he next
 recollected himself he had paid the hotel bill and was stepping
 into a taxi at the door. It was raining torrents.
 
 On the train for Princeton he saw no one he knew, only a crowd of
 fagged-looking Philadelphians. The presence of a painted woman
 across the aisle filled him with a fresh burst of sickness and he
 changed to another car, tried to concentrate on an article in a
 popular magazine. He found himself reading the same paragraphs
 over and over, so he abandoned this attempt and leaning over
 wearily pressed his hot forehead against the damp window-pane.
 The car, a smoker, was hot and stuffy with most of the smells of
 the state’s alien population; he opened a window and shivered
 against the cloud of fog that drifted in over him. The two hours’
 ride were like days, and he nearly cried aloud with joy when the
 towers of Princeton loomed up beside him and the yellow squares
 of light filtered through the blue rain.
 
 Tom was standing in the centre of the room, pensively relighting
 a cigar-stub. Amory fancied he looked rather relieved on seeing
 him.
 
 “Had a hell of a dream about you last night,” came in the cracked
 voice through the cigar smoke. “I had an idea you were in some
 trouble.”
 
 “Don’t tell me about it!” Amory almost shrieked. “Don’t say a
 word; I’m tired and pepped out.”
 
 Tom looked at him queerly and then sank into a chair and opened
 his Italian note-book. Amory threw his coat and hat on the floor,
 loosened his collar, and took a Wells novel at random from the
 shelf. “Wells is sane,” he thought, “and if he won’t do I’ll read
 Rupert Brooke.”
 
 Half an hour passed. Outside the wind came up, and Amory started
 as the wet branches moved and clawed with their finger-nails at
 the window-pane. Tom was deep in his work, and inside the room
 only the occasional scratch of a match or the rustle of leather
 as they shifted in their chairs broke the stillness. Then like a
 zigzag of lightning came the change. Amory sat bolt upright,
 frozen cold in his chair. Tom was looking at him with his mouth
 drooping, eyes fixed.
 
 “God help us!” Amory cried.
 
 “Oh, my heavens!” shouted Tom, “look behind!” Quick as a flash
 Amory whirled around. He saw nothing but the dark window-pane.
 “It’s gone now,” came Tom’s voice after a second in a still
 terror. “Something was looking at you.”
 
 Trembling violently, Amory dropped into his chair again.
 
 “I’ve got to tell you,” he said. “I’ve had one hell of an
 experience. I think I’ve—I’ve seen the devil or—something like
 him. What face did you just see?—or no,” he added quickly, “don’t
 tell me!”
 
 And he gave Tom the story. It was midnight when he finished, and
 after that, with all lights burning, two sleepy, shivering boys
 read to each other from “The New Machiavelli,” until dawn came up
 out of Witherspoon Hall, and the Princetonian fell against the
 door, and the May birds hailed the sun on last night’s rain.
 
 
 
 CHAPTER 4. Narcissus Off Duty
 
 
 During Princeton’s transition period, that is, during Amory’s
 last two years there, while he saw it change and broaden and live
 up to its Gothic beauty by better means than night parades,
 certain individuals arrived who stirred it to its plethoric
 depths. Some of them had been freshmen, and wild freshmen, with
 Amory; some were in the class below; and it was in the beginning
 of his last year and around small tables at the Nassau Inn that
 they began questioning aloud the institutions that Amory and
 countless others before him had questioned so long in secret.
 First, and partly by accident, they struck on certain books, a
 definite type of biographical novel that Amory christened “quest”
 books. In the “quest” book the hero set off in life armed with
 the best weapons and avowedly intending to use them as such
 weapons are usually used, to push their possessors ahead as
 selfishly and blindly as possible, but the heroes of the “quest”
 books discovered that there might be a more magnificent use for
 them. “None Other Gods,” “Sinister Street,” and “The Research
 Magnificent” were examples of such books; it was the latter of
 these three that gripped Burne Holiday and made him wonder in the
 beginning of senior year how much it was worth while being a
 diplomatic autocrat around his club on Prospect Avenue and
 basking in the high lights of class office. It was distinctly
 through the channels of aristocracy that Burne found his way.
 Amory, through Kerry, had had a vague drifting acquaintance with
 him, but not until January of senior year did their friendship
 commence.
 
 “Heard the latest?” said Tom, coming in late one drizzly evening
 with that triumphant air he always wore after a successful
 conversational bout.
 
 “No. Somebody flunked out? Or another ship sunk?”
 
 “Worse than that. About one-third of the junior class are going
 to resign from their clubs.”
 
 “What!”
 
 “Actual fact!”
 
 “Why!”
 
 “Spirit of reform and all that. Burne Holiday is behind it. The
 club presidents are holding a meeting to-night to see if they can
 find a joint means of combating it.”
 
 “Well, what’s the idea of the thing?”
 
 “Oh, clubs injurious to Princeton democracy; cost a lot; draw
 social lines, take time; the regular line you get sometimes from
 disappointed sophomores. Woodrow thought they should be abolished
 and all that.”
 
 “But this is the real thing?”
 
 “Absolutely. I think it’ll go through.”
 
 “For Pete’s sake, tell me more about it.”
 
 “Well,” began Tom, “it seems that the idea developed
 simultaneously in several heads. I was talking to Burne awhile
 ago, and he claims that it’s a logical result if an intelligent
 person thinks long enough about the social system. They had a
 ‘discussion crowd’ and the point of abolishing the clubs was
 brought up by some one—everybody there leaped at it—it had been
 in each one’s mind, more or less, and it just needed a spark to
 bring it out.”
 
 “Fine! I swear I think it’ll be most entertaining. How do they
 feel up at Cap and Gown?”
 
 “Wild, of course. Every one’s been sitting and arguing and
 swearing and getting mad and getting sentimental and getting
 brutal. It’s the same at all the clubs; I’ve been the rounds.
 They get one of the radicals in the corner and fire questions at
 him.”
 
 “How do the radicals stand up?”
 
 “Oh, moderately well. Burne’s a damn good talker, and so
 obviously sincere that you can’t get anywhere with him. It’s so
 evident that resigning from his club means so much more to him
 than preventing it does to us that I felt futile when I argued;
 finally took a position that was brilliantly neutral. In fact, I
 believe Burne thought for a while that he’d converted me.”
 
 “And you say almost a third of the junior class are going to
 resign?”
 
 “Call it a fourth and be safe.”
 
 “Lord—who’d have thought it possible!”
 
 There was a brisk knock at the door, and Burne himself came in.
 “Hello, Amory—hello, Tom.”
 
 Amory rose.
 
 “’Evening, Burne. Don’t mind if I seem to rush; I’m going to
 Renwick’s.”
 
 Burne turned to him quickly.
 
 “You probably know what I want to talk to Tom about, and it isn’t
 a bit private. I wish you’d stay.”
 
 “I’d be glad to.” Amory sat down again, and as Burne perched on a
 table and launched into argument with Tom, he looked at this
 revolutionary more carefully than he ever had before.
 Broad-browed and strong-chinned, with a fineness in the honest
 gray eyes that were like Kerry’s, Burne was a man who gave an
 immediate impression of bigness and security—stubborn, that was
 evident, but his stubbornness wore no stolidity, and when he had
 talked for five minutes Amory knew that this keen enthusiasm had
 in it no quality of dilettantism.
 
 The intense power Amory felt later in Burne Holiday differed from
 the admiration he had had for Humbird. This time it began as
 purely a mental interest. With other men of whom he had thought
 as primarily first-class, he had been attracted first by their
 personalities, and in Burne he missed that immediate magnetism to
 which he usually swore allegiance. But that night Amory was
 struck by Burne’s intense earnestness, a quality he was
 accustomed to associate only with the dread stupidity, and by the
 great enthusiasm that struck dead chords in his heart. Burne
 stood vaguely for a land Amory hoped he was drifting toward—and
 it was almost time that land was in sight. Tom and Amory and Alec
 had reached an impasse; never did they seem to have new
 experiences in common, for Tom and Alec had been as blindly busy
 with their committees and boards as Amory had been blindly
 idling, and the things they had for dissection—college,
 contemporary personality and the like—they had hashed and
 rehashed for many a frugal conversational meal.
 
 That night they discussed the clubs until twelve, and, in the
 main, they agreed with Burne. To the roommates it did not seem
 such a vital subject as it had in the two years before, but the
 logic of Burne’s objections to the social system dovetailed so
 completely with everything they had thought, that they questioned
 rather than argued, and envied the sanity that enabled this man
 to stand out so against all traditions.
 
 Then Amory branched off and found that Burne was deep in other
 things as well. Economics had interested him and he was turning
 socialist. Pacifism played in the back of his mind, and he read
 The Masses and Lyoff Tolstoi faithfully.
 
 “How about religion?” Amory asked him.
 
 “Don’t know. I’m in a muddle about a lot of things—I’ve just
 discovered that I’ve a mind, and I’m starting to read.”
 
 “Read what?”
 
 “Everything. I have to pick and choose, of course, but mostly
 things to make me think. I’m reading the four gospels now, and
 the ‘Varieties of Religious Experience.’”
 
 “What chiefly started you?”
 
 “Wells, I guess, and Tolstoi, and a man named Edward Carpenter.
 I’ve been reading for over a year now—on a few lines, on what I
 consider the essential lines.”
 
 “Poetry?”
 
 “Well, frankly, not what you call poetry, or for your reasons—you
 two write, of course, and look at things differently. Whitman is
 the man that attracts me.”
 
 “Whitman?”
 
 “Yes; he’s a definite ethical force.”
 
 “Well, I’m ashamed to say that I’m a blank on the subject of
 Whitman. How about you, Tom?”
 
 Tom nodded sheepishly.
 
 “Well,” continued Burne, “you may strike a few poems that are
 tiresome, but I mean the mass of his work. He’s tremendous—like
 Tolstoi. They both look things in the face, and, somehow,
 different as they are, stand for somewhat the same things.”
 
 “You have me stumped, Burne,” Amory admitted. “I’ve read ‘Anna
 Karenina’ and the ‘Kreutzer Sonata’ of course, but Tolstoi is
 mostly in the original Russian as far as I’m concerned.”
 
 “He’s the greatest man in hundreds of years,” cried Burne
 enthusiastically. “Did you ever see a picture of that shaggy old
 head of his?”
 
 They talked until three, from biology to organized religion, and
 when Amory crept shivering into bed it was with his mind aglow
 with ideas and a sense of shock that some one else had discovered
 the path he might have followed. Burne Holiday was so evidently
 developing—and Amory had considered that he was doing the same.
 He had fallen into a deep cynicism over what had crossed his
 path, plotted the imperfectability of man and read Shaw and
 Chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges of
 decadence—now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year
 and a half seemed stale and futile—a petty consummation of
 himself... and like a sombre background lay that incident of the
 spring before, that filled half his nights with a dreary terror
 and made him unable to pray. He was not even a Catholic, yet that
 was the only ghost of a code that he had, the gaudy, ritualistic,
 paradoxical Catholicism whose prophet was Chesterton, whose
 claqueurs were such reformed rakes of literature as Huysmans and
 Bourget, whose American sponsor was Ralph Adams Cram, with his
 adulation of thirteenth-century cathedrals—a Catholicism which
 Amory found convenient and ready-made, without priest or
 sacraments or sacrifice.
 
 He could not sleep, so he turned on his reading-lamp and, taking
 down the “Kreutzer Sonata,” searched it carefully for the germs
 of Burne’s enthusiasm. Being Burne was suddenly so much realler
 than being clever. Yet he sighed... here were other possible clay
 feet.
 
 He thought back through two years, of Burne as a hurried, nervous
 freshman, quite submerged in his brother’s personality. Then he
 remembered an incident of sophomore year, in which Burne had been
 suspected of the leading role.
 
 Dean Hollister had been heard by a large group arguing with a
 taxi-driver, who had driven him from the junction. In the course
 of the altercation the dean remarked that he “might as well buy
 the taxicab.” He paid and walked off, but next morning he entered
 his private office to find the taxicab itself in the space
 usually occupied by his desk, bearing a sign which read “Property
 of Dean Hollister. Bought and Paid for.”... It took two expert
 mechanics half a day to dissemble it into its minutest parts and
 remove it, which only goes to prove the rare energy of sophomore
 humor under efficient leadership.
 
 Then again, that very fall, Burne had caused a sensation. A
 certain Phyllis Styles, an intercollegiate prom-trotter, had
 failed to get her yearly invitation to the Harvard-Princeton
 game.
 
 Jesse Ferrenby had brought her to a smaller game a few weeks
 before, and had pressed Burne into service—to the ruination of
 the latter’s misogyny.
 
 “Are you coming to the Harvard game?” Burne had asked
 indiscreetly, merely to make conversation.
 
 “If you ask me,” cried Phyllis quickly.
 
 “Of course I do,” said Burne feebly. He was unversed in the arts
 of Phyllis, and was sure that this was merely a vapid form of
 kidding. Before an hour had passed he knew that he was indeed
 involved. Phyllis had pinned him down and served him up, informed
 him the train she was arriving by, and depressed him thoroughly.
 Aside from loathing Phyllis, he had particularly wanted to stag
 that game and entertain some Harvard friends.
 
 “She’ll see,” he informed a delegation who arrived in his room to
 josh him. “This will be the last game she ever persuades any
 young innocent to take her to!”
 
 “But, Burne—why did you _invite_ her if you didn’t want her?”
 
 “Burne, you _know_ you’re secretly mad about her—that’s the
 _real_ trouble.”
 
 “What can _you_ do, Burne? What can _you_ do against Phyllis?”
 
 But Burne only shook his head and muttered threats which
 consisted largely of the phrase: “She’ll see, she’ll see!”
 
 The blithesome Phyllis bore her twenty-five summers gayly from
 the train, but on the platform a ghastly sight met her eyes.
 There were Burne and Fred Sloane arrayed to the last dot like the
 lurid figures on college posters. They had bought flaring suits
 with huge peg-top trousers and gigantic padded shoulders. On
 their heads were rakish college hats, pinned up in front and
 sporting bright orange-and-black bands, while from their
 celluloid collars blossomed flaming orange ties. They wore black
 arm-bands with orange “P’s,” and carried canes flying Princeton
 pennants, the effect completed by socks and peeping handkerchiefs
 in the same color motifs. On a clanking chain they led a large,
 angry tom-cat, painted to represent a tiger.
 
 A good half of the station crowd was already staring at them,
 torn between horrified pity and riotous mirth, and as Phyllis,
 with her svelte jaw dropping, approached, the pair bent over and
 emitted a college cheer in loud, far-carrying voices,
 thoughtfully adding the name “Phyllis” to the end. She was
 vociferously greeted and escorted enthusiastically across the
 campus, followed by half a hundred village urchins—to the stifled
 laughter of hundreds of alumni and visitors, half of whom had no
 idea that this was a practical joke, but thought that Burne and
 Fred were two varsity sports showing their girl a collegiate
 time.
 
 Phyllis’s feelings as she was paraded by the Harvard and
 Princeton stands, where sat dozens of her former devotees, can be
 imagined. She tried to walk a little ahead, she tried to walk a
 little behind—but they stayed close, that there should be no
 doubt whom she was with, talking in loud voices of their friends
 on the football team, until she could almost hear her
 acquaintances whispering:
 
 “Phyllis Styles must be _awfully hard up_ to have to come with
 _those two_.”
 
 That had been Burne, dynamically humorous, fundamentally serious.
 From that root had blossomed the energy that he was now trying to
 orient with progress....
 
 So the weeks passed and March came and the clay feet that Amory
 looked for failed to appear. About a hundred juniors and seniors
 resigned from their clubs in a final fury of righteousness, and
 the clubs in helplessness turned upon Burne their finest weapon:
 ridicule. Every one who knew him liked him—but what he stood for
 (and he began to stand for more all the time) came under the lash
 of many tongues, until a frailer man than he would have been
 snowed under.
 
 “Don’t you mind losing prestige?” asked Amory one night. They had
 taken to exchanging calls several times a week.
 
 “Of course I don’t. What’s prestige, at best?”
 
 “Some people say that you’re just a rather original politician.”
 
 He roared with laughter.
 
 “That’s what Fred Sloane told me to-day. I suppose I have it
 coming.”
 
 One afternoon they dipped into a subject that had interested
 Amory for a long time—the matter of the bearing of physical
 attributes on a man’s make-up. Burne had gone into the biology of
 this, and then:
 
 “Of course health counts—a healthy man has twice the chance of
 being good,” he said.
 
 “I don’t agree with you—I don’t believe in ‘muscular
 Christianity.’”
 
 “I do—I believe Christ had great physical vigor.”
 
 “Oh, no,” Amory protested. “He worked too hard for that. I
 imagine that when he died he was a broken-down man—and the great
 saints haven’t been strong.”
 
 “Half of them have.”
 
 “Well, even granting that, I don’t think health has anything to
 do with goodness; of course, it’s valuable to a great saint to be
 able to stand enormous strains, but this fad of popular preachers
 rising on their toes in simulated virility, bellowing that
 calisthenics will save the world—no, Burne, I can’t go that.”
 
 “Well, let’s waive it—we won’t get anywhere, and besides I
 haven’t quite made up my mind about it myself. Now, here’s
 something I _do_ know—personal appearance has a lot to do with
 it.”
 
 “Coloring?” Amory asked eagerly.
 
 “Yes.”
 
 “That’s what Tom and I figured,” Amory agreed. “We took the
 year-books for the last ten years and looked at the pictures of
 the senior council. I know you don’t think much of that august
 body, but it does represent success here in a general way. Well,
 I suppose only about thirty-five per cent of every class here are
 blonds, are really light—yet _two-thirds_ of every senior council
 are light. We looked at pictures of ten years of them, mind you;
 that means that out of every _fifteen_ light-haired men in the
 senior class _one_ is on the senior council, and of the
 dark-haired men it’s only one in _fifty_.”
 
 “It’s true,” Burne agreed. “The light-haired man _is_ a higher
 type, generally speaking. I worked the thing out with the
 Presidents of the United States once, and found that way over
 half of them were light-haired—yet think of the preponderant
 number of brunettes in the race.”
 
 “People unconsciously admit it,” said Amory. “You’ll notice a
 blond person is _expected_ to talk. If a blond girl doesn’t talk
 we call her a ‘doll’; if a light-haired man is silent he’s
 considered stupid. Yet the world is full of ‘dark silent men’ and
 ‘languorous brunettes’ who haven’t a brain in their heads, but
 somehow are never accused of the dearth.”
 
 “And the large mouth and broad chin and rather big nose
 undoubtedly make the superior face.”
 
 “I’m not so sure.” Amory was all for classical features.
 
 “Oh, yes—I’ll show you,” and Burne pulled out of his desk a
 photographic collection of heavily bearded, shaggy
 celebrities—Tolstoi, Whitman, Carpenter, and others.
 
 “Aren’t they wonderful?”
 
 Amory tried politely to appreciate them, and gave up laughingly.
 
 “Burne, I think they’re the ugliest-looking crowd I ever came
 across. They look like an old man’s home.”
 
 “Oh, Amory, look at that forehead on Emerson; look at Tolstoi’s
 eyes.” His tone was reproachful.
 
 Amory shook his head.
 
 “No! Call them remarkable-looking or anything you want—but ugly
 they certainly are.”
 
 Unabashed, Burne ran his hand lovingly across the spacious
 foreheads, and piling up the pictures put them back in his desk.
 
 Walking at night was one of his favorite pursuits, and one night
 he persuaded Amory to accompany him.
 
 “I hate the dark,” Amory objected. “I didn’t use to—except when I
 was particularly imaginative, but now, I really do—I’m a regular
 fool about it.”
 
 “That’s useless, you know.”
 
 “Quite possibly.”
 
 “We’ll go east,” Burne suggested, “and down that string of roads
 through the woods.”
 
 “Doesn’t sound very appealing to me,” admitted Amory reluctantly,
 “but let’s go.”
 
 They set off at a good gait, and for an hour swung along in a
 brisk argument until the lights of Princeton were luminous white
 blots behind them.
 
 “Any person with any imagination is bound to be afraid,” said
 Burne earnestly. “And this very walking at night is one of the
 things I was afraid about. I’m going to tell you why I can walk
 anywhere now and not be afraid.”
 
 “Go on,” Amory urged eagerly. They were striding toward the
 woods, Burne’s nervous, enthusiastic voice warming to his
 subject.
 
 “I used to come out here alone at night, oh, three months ago,
 and I always stopped at that cross-road we just passed. There
 were the woods looming up ahead, just as they do now, there were
 dogs howling and the shadows and no human sound. Of course, I
 peopled the woods with everything ghastly, just like you do;
 don’t you?”
 
 “I do,” Amory admitted.
 
 “Well, I began analyzing it—my imagination persisted in sticking
 horrors into the dark—so I stuck my imagination into the dark
 instead, and let it look out at me—I let it play stray dog or
 escaped convict or ghost, and then saw myself coming along the
 road. That made it all right—as it always makes everything all
 right to project yourself completely into another’s place. I knew
 that if I were the dog or the convict or the ghost I wouldn’t be
 a menace to Burne Holiday any more than he was a menace to me.
 Then I thought of my watch. I’d better go back and leave it and
 then essay the woods. No; I decided, it’s better on the whole
 that I should lose a watch than that I should turn back—and I did
 go into them—not only followed the road through them, but walked
 into them until I wasn’t frightened any more—did it until one
 night I sat down and dozed off in there; then I knew I was
 through being afraid of the dark.”
 
 “Lordy,” Amory breathed. “I couldn’t have done that. I’d have
 come out half-way, and the first time an automobile passed and
 made the dark thicker when its lamps disappeared, I’d have come
 in.”
 
 “Well,” Burne said suddenly, after a few moments’ silence, “we’re
 half-way through, let’s turn back.”
 
 On the return he launched into a discussion of will.
 
 “It’s the whole thing,” he asserted. “It’s the one dividing line
 between good and evil. I’ve never met a man who led a rotten life
 and didn’t have a weak will.”
 
 “How about great criminals?”
 
 “They’re usually insane. If not, they’re weak. There is no such
 thing as a strong, sane criminal.”
 
 “Burne, I disagree with you altogether; how about the superman?”
 
 “Well?”
 
 “He’s evil, I think, yet he’s strong and sane.”
 
 “I’ve never met him. I’ll bet, though, that he’s stupid or
 insane.”
 
 “I’ve met him over and over and he’s neither. That’s why I think
 you’re wrong.”
 
 “I’m sure I’m not—and so I don’t believe in imprisonment except
 for the insane.”
 
 On this point Amory could not agree. It seemed to him that life
 and history were rife with the strong criminal, keen, but often
 self-deluding; in politics and business one found him and among
 the old statesmen and kings and generals; but Burne never agreed
 and their courses began to split on that point.
 
 Burne was drawing farther and farther away from the world about
 him. He resigned the vice-presidency of the senior class and took
 to reading and walking as almost his only pursuits. He
 voluntarily attended graduate lectures in philosophy and biology,
 and sat in all of them with a rather pathetically intent look in
 his eyes, as if waiting for something the lecturer would never
 quite come to. Sometimes Amory would see him squirm in his seat;
 and his face would light up; he was on fire to debate a point.
 
 He grew more abstracted on the street and was even accused of
 becoming a snob, but Amory knew it was nothing of the sort, and
 once when Burne passed him four feet off, absolutely unseeingly,
 his mind a thousand miles away, Amory almost choked with the
 romantic joy of watching him. Burne seemed to be climbing heights
 where others would be forever unable to get a foothold.
 
 “I tell you,” Amory declared to Tom, “he’s the first contemporary
 I’ve ever met whom I’ll admit is my superior in mental capacity.”
 
 “It’s a bad time to admit it—people are beginning to think he’s
 odd.”
 
 “He’s way over their heads—you know you think so yourself when
 you talk to him—Good Lord, Tom, you _used_ to stand out against
 ‘people.’ Success has completely conventionalized you.”
 
 Tom grew rather annoyed.
 
 “What’s he trying to do—be excessively holy?”
 
 “No! not like anybody you’ve ever seen. Never enters the
 Philadelphian Society. He has no faith in that rot. He doesn’t
 believe that public swimming-pools and a kind word in time will
 right the wrongs of the world; moreover, he takes a drink
 whenever he feels like it.”
 
 “He certainly is getting in wrong.”
 
 “Have you talked to him lately?”
 
 “No.”
 
 “Then you haven’t any conception of him.”
 
 The argument ended nowhere, but Amory noticed more than ever how
 the sentiment toward Burne had changed on the campus.
 
 “It’s odd,” Amory said to Tom one night when they had grown more
 amicable on the subject, “that the people who violently
 disapprove of Burne’s radicalism are distinctly the Pharisee
 class—I mean they’re the best-educated men in college—the editors
 of the papers, like yourself and Ferrenby, the younger
 professors.... The illiterate athletes like Langueduc think he’s
 getting eccentric, but they just say, ‘Good old Burne has got
 some queer ideas in his head,’ and pass on—the Pharisee
 class—Gee! they ridicule him unmercifully.”
 
 The next morning he met Burne hurrying along McCosh walk after a
 recitation.
 
 “Whither bound, Tsar?”
 
 “Over to the Prince office to see Ferrenby,” he waved a copy of
 the morning’s Princetonian at Amory. “He wrote this editorial.”
 
 “Going to flay him alive?”
 
 “No—but he’s got me all balled up. Either I’ve misjudged him or
 he’s suddenly become the world’s worst radical.”
 
 Burne hurried on, and it was several days before Amory heard an
 account of the ensuing conversation. Burne had come into the
 editor’s sanctum displaying the paper cheerfully.
 
 “Hello, Jesse.”
 
 “Hello there, Savonarola.”
 
 “I just read your editorial.”
 
 “Good boy—didn’t know you stooped that low.”
 
 “Jesse, you startled me.”
 
 “How so?”
 
 “Aren’t you afraid the faculty’ll get after you if you pull this
 irreligious stuff?”
 
 “What?”
 
 “Like this morning.”
 
 “What the devil—that editorial was on the coaching system.”
 
 “Yes, but that quotation—”
 
 Jesse sat up.
 
 “What quotation?”
 
 “You know: ‘He who is not with me is against me.’”
 
 “Well—what about it?”
 
 Jesse was puzzled but not alarmed.
 
 “Well, you say here—let me see.” Burne opened the paper and read:
 “‘_He who is not with me is against me_, as that gentleman said
 who was notoriously capable of only coarse distinctions and
 puerile generalities.’”
 
 “What of it?” Ferrenby began to look alarmed. “Oliver Cromwell
 said it, didn’t he? or was it Washington, or one of the saints?
 Good Lord, I’ve forgotten.”
 
 Burne roared with laughter.
 
 “Oh, Jesse, oh, good, kind Jesse.”
 
 “Who said it, for Pete’s sake?”
 
 “Well,” said Burne, recovering his voice, “St. Matthew attributes
 it to Christ.”
 
 “My God!” cried Jesse, and collapsed backward into the
 waste-basket.
 
 
 AMORY WRITES A POEM
 
 The weeks tore by. Amory wandered occasionally to New York on the
 chance of finding a new shining green auto-bus, that its
 stick-of-candy glamour might penetrate his disposition. One day
 he ventured into a stock-company revival of a play whose name was
 faintly familiar. The curtain rose—he watched casually as a girl
 entered. A few phrases rang in his ear and touched a faint chord
 of memory. Where—? When—?
 
 Then he seemed to hear a voice whispering beside him, a very
 soft, vibrant voice: “Oh, I’m such a poor little fool; _do_ tell
 me when I do wrong.”
 
 The solution came in a flash and he had a quick, glad memory of
 Isabelle.
 
 He found a blank space on his programme, and began to scribble
 rapidly:
 
    “Here in the figured dark I watch once more, There, with the
    curtain, roll the years away; Two years of years—there was an idle
    day Of ours, when happy endings didn’t bore Our unfermented souls; I
    could adore Your eager face beside me, wide-eyed, gay, Smiling a
    repertoire while the poor play Reached me as a faint ripple reaches
    shore.
    “Yawning and wondering an evening through, I watch alone... and
    chatterings, of course, Spoil the one scene which, somehow, _did_
    have charms; You wept a bit, and I grew sad for you Right here! 
    Where Mr. X defends divorce And What’s-Her-Name falls fainting in
    his arms.”
 
 
 STILL CALM
 
 “Ghosts are such dumb things,” said Alec, “they’re slow-witted. I
 can always outguess a ghost.”
 
 “How?” asked Tom.
 
 “Well, it depends where. Take a bedroom, for example. If you use
 _any_ discretion a ghost can never get you in a bedroom.”
 
 “Go on, s’pose you think there’s maybe a ghost in your
 bedroom—what measures do you take on getting home at night?”
 demanded Amory, interested.
 
 “Take a stick” answered Alec, with ponderous reverence, “one
 about the length of a broom-handle. Now, the first thing to do is
 to get the room _cleared_—to do this you rush with your eyes
 closed into your study and turn on the lights—next, approaching
 the closet, carefully run the stick in the door three or four
 times. Then, if nothing happens, you can look in. _Always,
 always_ run the stick in viciously first—_never_ look first!”
 
 “Of course, that’s the ancient Celtic school,” said Tom gravely.
 
 “Yes—but they usually pray first. Anyway, you use this method to
 clear the closets and also for behind all doors—”
 
 “And the bed,” Amory suggested.
 
 “Oh, Amory, no!” cried Alec in horror. “That isn’t the way—the
 bed requires different tactics—let the bed alone, as you value
 your reason—if there is a ghost in the room and that’s only about
 a third of the time, it is _almost always_ under the bed.”
 
 “Well” Amory began.
 
 Alec waved him into silence.
 
 “Of _course_ you never look. You stand in the middle of the floor
 and before he knows what you’re going to do make a sudden leap
 for the bed—never walk near the bed; to a ghost your ankle is
 your most vulnerable part—once in bed, you’re safe; he may lie
 around under the bed all night, but you’re safe as daylight. If
 you still have doubts pull the blanket over your head.”
 
 “All that’s very interesting, Tom.”
 
 “Isn’t it?” Alec beamed proudly. “All my own, too—the Sir Oliver
 Lodge of the new world.”
 
 Amory was enjoying college immensely again. The sense of going
 forward in a direct, determined line had come back; youth was
 stirring and shaking out a few new feathers. He had even stored
 enough surplus energy to sally into a new pose.
 
 “What’s the idea of all this ‘distracted’ stuff, Amory?” asked
 Alec one day, and then as Amory pretended to be cramped over his
 book in a daze: “Oh, don’t try to act Burne, the mystic, to me.”
 
 Amory looked up innocently.
 
 “What?”
 
 “What?” mimicked Alec. “Are you trying to read yourself into a
 rhapsody with—let’s see the book.”
 
 He snatched it; regarded it derisively.
 
 “Well?” said Amory a little stiffly.
 
 “‘The Life of St. Teresa,’” read Alec aloud. “Oh, my gosh!”
 
 “Say, Alec.”
 
 “What?”
 
 “Does it bother you?”
 
 “Does what bother me?”
 
 “My acting dazed and all that?”
 
 “Why, no—of course it doesn’t _bother_ me.”
 
 “Well, then, don’t spoil it. If I enjoy going around telling
 people guilelessly that I think I’m a genius, let me do it.”
 
 “You’re getting a reputation for being eccentric,” said Alec,
 laughing, “if that’s what you mean.”
 
 Amory finally prevailed, and Alec agreed to accept his face value
 in the presence of others if he was allowed rest periods when
 they were alone; so Amory “ran it out” at a great rate, bringing
 the most eccentric characters to dinner, wild-eyed grad students,
 preceptors with strange theories of God and government, to the
 cynical amazement of the supercilious Cottage Club.
 
 As February became slashed by sun and moved cheerfully into
 March, Amory went several times to spend week-ends with
 Monsignor; once he took Burne, with great success, for he took
 equal pride and delight in displaying them to each other.
 Monsignor took him several times to see Thornton Hancock, and
 once or twice to the house of a Mrs. Lawrence, a type of
 Rome-haunting American whom Amory liked immediately.
 
 Then one day came a letter from Monsignor, which appended an
 interesting P. S.:
 
   “Do you know,” it ran, “that your third cousin, Clara Page, widowed
   six months and very poor, is living in Philadelphia? I don’t think
   you’ve ever met her, but I wish, as a favor to me, you’d go to see
   her.  To my mind, she’s rather a remarkable woman, and just about
   your age.”
 
 Amory sighed and decided to go, as a favor....
 
 
 CLARA
 
 She was immemorial.... Amory wasn’t good enough for Clara, Clara
 of ripply golden hair, but then no man was. Her goodness was
 above the prosy morals of the husband-seeker, apart from the dull
 literature of female virtue.
 
 Sorrow lay lightly around her, and when Amory found her in
 Philadelphia he thought her steely blue eyes held only happiness;
 a latent strength, a realism, was brought to its fullest
 development by the facts that she was compelled to face. She was
 alone in the world, with two small children, little money, and,
 worst of all, a host of friends. He saw her that winter in
 Philadelphia entertaining a houseful of men for an evening, when
 he knew she had not a servant in the house except the little
 colored girl guarding the babies overhead. He saw one of the
 greatest libertines in that city, a man who was habitually drunk
 and notorious at home and abroad, sitting opposite her for an
 evening, discussing _girls’ boarding-schools_ with a sort of
 innocent excitement. What a twist Clara had to her mind! She
 could make fascinating and almost brilliant conversation out of
 the thinnest air that ever floated through a drawing-room.
 
 The idea that the girl was poverty-stricken had appealed to
 Amory’s sense of situation. He arrived in Philadelphia expecting
 to be told that 921 Ark Street was in a miserable lane of hovels.
 He was even disappointed when it proved to be nothing of the
 sort. It was an old house that had been in her husband’s family
 for years. An elderly aunt, who objected to having it sold, had
 put ten years’ taxes with a lawyer and pranced off to Honolulu,
 leaving Clara to struggle with the heating-problem as best she
 could. So no wild-haired woman with a hungry baby at her breast
 and a sad Amelia-like look greeted him. Instead, Amory would have
 thought from his reception that she had not a care in the world.
 
 A calm virility and a dreamy humor, marked contrasts to her
 level-headedness—into these moods she slipped sometimes as a
 refuge. She could do the most prosy things (though she was wise
 enough never to stultify herself with such “household arts” as
 _knitting_ and _embroidery_), yet immediately afterward pick up a
 book and let her imagination rove as a formless cloud with the
 wind. Deepest of all in her personality was the golden radiance
 that she diffused around her. As an open fire in a dark room
 throws romance and pathos into the quiet faces at its edge, so
 she cast her lights and shadows around the rooms that held her,
 until she made of her prosy old uncle a man of quaint and
 meditative charm, metamorphosed the stray telegraph boy into a
 Puck-like creature of delightful originality. At first this
 quality of hers somehow irritated Amory. He considered his own
 uniqueness sufficient, and it rather embarrassed him when she
 tried to read new interests into him for the benefit of what
 other adorers were present. He felt as if a polite but insistent
 stage-manager were attempting to make him give a new
 interpretation of a part he had conned for years.
 
 But Clara talking, Clara telling a slender tale of a hatpin and
 an inebriated man and herself.... People tried afterward to
 repeat her anecdotes but for the life of them they could make
 them sound like nothing whatever. They gave her a sort of
 innocent attention and the best smiles many of them had smiled
 for long; there were few tears in Clara, but people smiled
 misty-eyed at her.
 
 Very occasionally Amory stayed for little half-hours after the
 rest of the court had gone, and they would have bread and jam and
 tea late in the afternoon or “maple-sugar lunches,” as she called
 them, at night.
 
 “You _are_ remarkable, aren’t you!” Amory was becoming trite from
 where he perched in the centre of the dining-room table one six
 o’clock.
 
 “Not a bit,” she answered. She was searching out napkins in the
 sideboard. “I’m really most humdrum and commonplace. One of those
 people who have no interest in anything but their children.”
 
 “Tell that to somebody else,” scoffed Amory. “You know you’re
 perfectly effulgent.” He asked her the one thing that he knew
 might embarrass her. It was the remark that the first bore made
 to Adam.
 
 “Tell me about yourself.” And she gave the answer that Adam must
 have given.
 
 “There’s nothing to tell.”
 
 But eventually Adam probably told the bore all the things he
 thought about at night when the locusts sang in the sandy grass,
 and he must have remarked patronizingly how _different_ he was
 from Eve, forgetting how different she was from him... at any
 rate, Clara told Amory much about herself that evening. She had
 had a harried life from sixteen on, and her education had stopped
 sharply with her leisure. Browsing in her library, Amory found a
 tattered gray book out of which fell a yellow sheet that he
 impudently opened. It was a poem that she had written at school
 about a gray convent wall on a gray day, and a girl with her
 cloak blown by the wind sitting atop of it and thinking about the
 many-colored world. As a rule such sentiment bored him, but this
 was done with so much simplicity and atmosphere, that it brought
 a picture of Clara to his mind, of Clara on such a cool, gray day
 with her keen blue eyes staring out, trying to see her tragedies
 come marching over the gardens outside. He envied that poem. How
 he would have loved to have come along and seen her on the wall
 and talked nonsense or romance to her, perched above him in the
 air. He began to be frightfully jealous of everything about
 Clara: of her past, of her babies, of the men and women who
 flocked to drink deep of her cool kindness and rest their tired
 minds as at an absorbing play.
 
 “_Nobody_ seems to bore you,” he objected.
 
 “About half the world do,” she admitted, “but I think that’s a
 pretty good average, don’t you?” and she turned to find something
 in Browning that bore on the subject. She was the only person he
 ever met who could look up passages and quotations to show him in
 the middle of the conversation, and yet not be irritating to
 distraction. She did it constantly, with such a serious
 enthusiasm that he grew fond of watching her golden hair bent
 over a book, brow wrinkled ever so little at hunting her
 sentence.
 
 Through early March he took to going to Philadelphia for
 week-ends. Almost always there was some one else there and she
 seemed not anxious to see him alone, for many occasions presented
 themselves when a word from her would have given him another
 delicious half-hour of adoration. But he fell gradually in love
 and began to speculate wildly on marriage. Though this design
 flowed through his brain even to his lips, still he knew
 afterward that the desire had not been deeply rooted. Once he
 dreamt that it had come true and woke up in a cold panic, for in
 his dream she had been a silly, flaxen Clara, with the gold gone
 out of her hair and platitudes falling insipidly from her
 changeling tongue. But she was the first fine woman he ever knew
 and one of the few good people who ever interested him. She made
 her goodness such an asset. Amory had decided that most good
 people either dragged theirs after them as a liability, or else
 distorted it to artificial geniality, and of course there were
 the ever-present prig and Pharisee—(but Amory never included
 _them_ as being among the saved).
 
 
 ST. CECILIA
 
    “Over her gray and velvet dress, Under her molten, beaten hair,
    Color of rose in mock distress Flushes and fades and makes her fair;
    Fills the air from her to him With light and languor and little
    sighs, Just so subtly he scarcely knows... Laughing lightning, color
    of rose.”
 
 “Do you like me?”
 
 “Of course I do,” said Clara seriously.
 
 “Why?”
 
 “Well, we have some qualities in common. Things that are
 spontaneous in each of us—or were originally.”
 
 “You’re implying that I haven’t used myself very well?”
 
 Clara hesitated.
 
 “Well, I can’t judge. A man, of course, has to go through a lot
 more, and I’ve been sheltered.”
 
 “Oh, don’t stall, please, Clara,” Amory interrupted; “but do talk
 about me a little, won’t you?”
 
 “Surely, I’d adore to.” She didn’t smile.
 
 “That’s sweet of you. First answer some questions. Am I painfully
 conceited?”
 
 “Well—no, you have tremendous vanity, but it’ll amuse the people
 who notice its preponderance.”
 
 “I see.”
 
 “You’re really humble at heart. You sink to the third hell of
 depression when you think you’ve been slighted. In fact, you
 haven’t much self-respect.”
 
 “Centre of target twice, Clara. How do you do it? You never let
 me say a word.”
 
 “Of course not—I can never judge a man while he’s talking. But
 I’m not through; the reason you have so little real
 self-confidence, even though you gravely announce to the
 occasional philistine that you think you’re a genius, is that
 you’ve attributed all sorts of atrocious faults to yourself and
 are trying to live up to them. For instance, you’re always saying
 that you are a slave to high-balls.”
 
 “But I am, potentially.”
 
 “And you say you’re a weak character, that you’ve no will.”
 
 “Not a bit of will—I’m a slave to my emotions, to my likes, to my
 hatred of boredom, to most of my desires—”
 
 “You are not!” She brought one little fist down onto the other.
 “You’re a slave, a bound helpless slave to one thing in the
 world, your imagination.”
 
 “You certainly interest me. If this isn’t boring you, go on.”
 
 “I notice that when you want to stay over an extra day from
 college you go about it in a sure way. You never decide at first
 while the merits of going or staying are fairly clear in your
 mind. You let your imagination shinny on the side of your desires
 for a few hours, and then you decide. Naturally your imagination,
 after a little freedom, thinks up a million reasons why you
 should stay, so your decision when it comes isn’t true. It’s
 biassed.”
 
 “Yes,” objected Amory, “but isn’t it lack of will-power to let my
 imagination shinny on the wrong side?”
 
 “My dear boy, there’s your big mistake. This has nothing to do
 with will-power; that’s a crazy, useless word, anyway; you lack
 judgment—the judgment to decide at once when you know your
 imagination will play you false, given half a chance.”
 
 “Well, I’ll be darned!” exclaimed Amory in surprise, “that’s the
 last thing I expected.”
 
 Clara didn’t gloat. She changed the subject immediately. But she
 had started him thinking and he believed she was partly right. He
 felt like a factory-owner who after accusing a clerk of
 dishonesty finds that his own son, in the office, is changing the
 books once a week. His poor, mistreated will that he had been
 holding up to the scorn of himself and his friends, stood before
 him innocent, and his judgment walked off to prison with the
 unconfinable imp, imagination, dancing in mocking glee beside
 him. Clara’s was the only advice he ever asked without dictating
 the answer himself—except, perhaps, in his talks with Monsignor
 Darcy.
 
 How he loved to do any sort of thing with Clara! Shopping with
 her was a rare, epicurean dream. In every store where she had
 ever traded she was whispered about as the beautiful Mrs. Page.
 
 “I’ll bet she won’t stay single long.”
 
 “Well, don’t scream it out. She ain’t lookin’ for no advice.”
 
 “_Ain’t_ she beautiful!”
 
    (Enter a floor-walker—silence till he moves forward, smirking.)
 
 “Society person, ain’t she?”
 
 “Yeah, but poor now, I guess; so they say.”
 
 “Gee! girls, _ain’t_ she some kid!”
 
 And Clara beamed on all alike. Amory believed that tradespeople
 gave her discounts, sometimes to her knowledge and sometimes
 without it. He knew she dressed very well, had always the best of
 everything in the house, and was inevitably waited upon by the
 head floor-walker at the very least.
 
 Sometimes they would go to church together on Sunday and he would
 walk beside her and revel in her cheeks moist from the soft water
 in the new air. She was very devout, always had been, and God
 knows what heights she attained and what strength she drew down
 to herself when she knelt and bent her golden hair into the
 stained-glass light.
 
 “St. Cecelia,” he cried aloud one day, quite involuntarily, and
 the people turned and peered, and the priest paused in his sermon
 and Clara and Amory turned to fiery red.
 
 That was the last Sunday they had, for he spoiled it all that
 night. He couldn’t help it.
 
 They were walking through the March twilight where it was as warm
 as June, and the joy of youth filled his soul so that he felt he
 must speak.
 
 “I think,” he said and his voice trembled, “that if I lost faith
 in you I’d lose faith in God.”
 
 She looked at him with such a startled face that he asked her the
 matter.
 
 “Nothing,” she said slowly, “only this: five men have said that
 to me before, and it frightens me.”
 
 “Oh, Clara, is that your fate!”
 
 She did not answer.
 
 “I suppose love to you is—” he began.
 
 She turned like a flash.
 
 “I have never been in love.”
 
 They walked along, and he realized slowly how much she had told
 him... never in love.... She seemed suddenly a daughter of light
 alone. His entity dropped out of her plane and he longed only to
 touch her dress with almost the realization that Joseph must have
 had of Mary’s eternal significance. But quite mechanically he
 heard himself saying:
 
 “And I love you—any latent greatness that I’ve got is... oh, I
 can’t talk, but Clara, if I come back in two years in a position
 to marry you—”
 
 She shook her head.
 
 “No,” she said; “I’d never marry again. I’ve got my two children
 and I want myself for them. I like you—I like all clever men, you
 more than any—but you know me well enough to know that I’d never
 marry a clever man—” She broke off suddenly.
 
 “Amory.”
 
 “What?”
 
 “You’re not in love with me. You never wanted to marry me, did
 you?”
 
 “It was the twilight,” he said wonderingly. “I didn’t feel as
 though I were speaking aloud. But I love you—or adore you—or
 worship you—”
 
 “There you go—running through your catalogue of emotions in five
 seconds.”
 
 He smiled unwillingly.
 
 “Don’t make me out such a light-weight, Clara; you _are_
 depressing sometimes.”
 
 “You’re not a light-weight, of all things,” she said intently,
 taking his arm and opening wide her eyes—he could see their
 kindliness in the fading dusk. “A light-weight is an eternal
 nay.”
 
 “There’s so much spring in the air—there’s so much lazy sweetness
 in your heart.”
 
 She dropped his arm.
 
 “You’re all fine now, and I feel glorious. Give me a cigarette.
 You’ve never seen me smoke, have you? Well, I do, about once a
 month.”
 
 And then that wonderful girl and Amory raced to the corner like
 two mad children gone wild with pale-blue twilight.
 
 “I’m going to the country for to-morrow,” she announced, as she
 stood panting, safe beyond the flare of the corner lamp-post.
 “These days are too magnificent to miss, though perhaps I feel
 them more in the city.”
 
 “Oh, Clara!” Amory said; “what a devil you could have been if the
 Lord had just bent your soul a little the other way!”
 
 “Maybe,” she answered; “but I think not. I’m never really wild
 and never have been. That little outburst was pure spring.”
 
 “And you are, too,” said he.
 
 They were walking along now.
 
 “No—you’re wrong again, how can a person of your own self-reputed
 brains be so constantly wrong about me? I’m the opposite of
 everything spring ever stood for. It’s unfortunate, if I happen
 to look like what pleased some soppy old Greek sculptor, but I
 assure you that if it weren’t for my face I’d be a quiet nun in
 the convent without”—then she broke into a run and her raised
 voice floated back to him as he followed—“my precious babies,
 which I must go back and see.”
 
 She was the only girl he ever knew with whom he could understand
 how another man might be preferred. Often Amory met wives whom he
 had known as debutantes, and looking intently at them imagined
 that he found something in their faces which said:
 
 “Oh, if I could only have gotten _you!_” Oh, the enormous conceit
 of the man!
 
 But that night seemed a night of stars and singing and Clara’s
 bright soul still gleamed on the ways they had trod.
 
 “Golden, golden is the air—” he chanted to the little pools of
 water. ... “Golden is the air, golden notes from golden
 mandolins, golden frets of golden violins, fair, oh, wearily
 fair.... Skeins from braided basket, mortals may not hold; oh,
 what young extravagant God, who would know or ask it?... who
 could give such gold...”
 
 
 AMORY IS RESENTFUL
 
 Slowly and inevitably, yet with a sudden surge at the last, while
 Amory talked and dreamed, war rolled swiftly up the beach and
 washed the sands where Princeton played. Every night the
 gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor
 and shuffled out the basket-ball markings. When Amory went to
 Washington the next week-end he caught some of the spirit of
 crisis which changed to repulsion in the Pullman car coming back,
 for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking
 aliens—Greeks, he guessed, or Russians. He thought how much
 easier patriotism had been to a homogeneous race, how much easier
 it would have been to fight as the Colonies fought, or as the
 Confederacy fought. And he did no sleeping that night, but
 listened to the aliens guffaw and snore while they filled the car
 with the heavy scent of latest America.
 
 In Princeton every one bantered in public and told themselves
 privately that their deaths at least would be heroic. The
 literary students read Rupert Brooke passionately; the
 lounge-lizards worried over whether the government would permit
 the English-cut uniform for officers; a few of the hopelessly
 lazy wrote to the obscure branches of the War Department, seeking
 an easy commission and a soft berth.
 
 Then, after a week, Amory saw Burne and knew at once that
 argument would be futile—Burne had come out as a pacifist. The
 socialist magazines, a great smattering of Tolstoi, and his own
 intense longing for a cause that would bring out whatever
 strength lay in him, had finally decided him to preach peace as a
 subjective ideal.
 
 “When the German army entered Belgium,” he began, “if the
 inhabitants had gone peaceably about their business, the German
 army would have been disorganized in—”
 
 “I know,” Amory interrupted, “I’ve heard it all. But I’m not
 going to talk propaganda with you. There’s a chance that you’re
 right—but even so we’re hundreds of years before the time when
 non-resistance can touch us as a reality.”
 
 “But, Amory, listen—”
 
 “Burne, we’d just argue—”
 
 “Very well.”
 
 “Just one thing—I don’t ask you to think of your family or
 friends, because I know they don’t count a picayune with you
 beside your sense of duty—but, Burne, how do you know that the
 magazines you read and the societies you join and these idealists
 you meet aren’t just plain _German?_”
 
 “Some of them are, of course.”
 
 “How do you know they aren’t _all_ pro-German—just a lot of weak
 ones—with German-Jewish names.”
 
 “That’s the chance, of course,” he said slowly. “How much or how
 little I’m taking this stand because of propaganda I’ve heard, I
 don’t know; naturally I think that it’s my most innermost
 conviction—it seems a path spread before me just now.”
 
 Amory’s heart sank.
 
 “But think of the cheapness of it—no one’s really going to martyr
 you for being a pacifist—it’s just going to throw you in with the
 worst—”
 
 “I doubt it,” he interrupted.
 
 “Well, it all smells of Bohemian New York to me.”
 
 “I know what you mean, and that’s why I’m not sure I’ll agitate.”
 
 “You’re one man, Burne—going to talk to people who won’t
 listen—with all God’s given you.”
 
 “That’s what Stephen must have thought many years ago. But he
 preached his sermon and they killed him. He probably thought as
 he was dying what a waste it all was. But you see, I’ve always
 felt that Stephen’s death was the thing that occurred to Paul on
 the road to Damascus, and sent him to preach the word of Christ
 all over the world.”
 
 “Go on.”
 
 “That’s all—this is my particular duty. Even if right now I’m
 just a pawn—just sacrificed. God! Amory—you don’t think I like
 the Germans!”
 
 “Well, I can’t say anything else—I get to the end of all the
 logic about non-resistance, and there, like an excluded middle,
 stands the huge spectre of man as he is and always will be. And
 this spectre stands right beside the one logical necessity of
 Tolstoi’s, and the other logical necessity of Nietzsche’s—” Amory
 broke off suddenly. “When are you going?”
 
 “I’m going next week.”
 
 “I’ll see you, of course.”
 
 As he walked away it seemed to Amory that the look in his face
 bore a great resemblance to that in Kerry’s when he had said
 good-by under Blair Arch two years before. Amory wondered
 unhappily why he could never go into anything with the primal
 honesty of those two.
 
 “Burne’s a fanatic,” he said to Tom, “and he’s dead wrong and,
 I’m inclined to think, just an unconscious pawn in the hands of
 anarchistic publishers and German-paid rag wavers—but he haunts
 me—just leaving everything worth while—”
 
 Burne left in a quietly dramatic manner a week later. He sold all
 his possessions and came down to the room to say good-by, with a
 battered old bicycle, on which he intended to ride to his home in
 Pennsylvania.
 
 “Peter the Hermit bidding farewell to Cardinal Richelieu,”
 suggested Alec, who was lounging in the window-seat as Burne and
 Amory shook hands.
 
 But Amory was not in a mood for that, and as he saw Burne’s long
 legs propel his ridiculous bicycle out of sight beyond Alexander
 Hall, he knew he was going to have a bad week. Not that he
 doubted the war—Germany stood for everything repugnant to him;
 for materialism and the direction of tremendous licentious force;
 it was just that Burne’s face stayed in his memory and he was
 sick of the hysteria he was beginning to hear.
 
 “What on earth is the use of suddenly running down Goethe,” he
 declared to Alec and Tom. “Why write books to prove he started
 the war—or that that stupid, overestimated Schiller is a demon in
 disguise?”
 
 “Have you ever read anything of theirs?” asked Tom shrewdly.
 
 “No,” Amory admitted.
 
 “Neither have I,” he said laughing.
 
 “People will shout,” said Alec quietly, “but Goethe’s on his same
 old shelf in the library—to bore any one that wants to read him!”
 
 Amory subsided, and the subject dropped.
 
 “What are you going to do, Amory?”
 
 “Infantry or aviation, I can’t make up my mind—I hate mechanics,
 but then of course aviation’s the thing for me—”
 
 “I feel as Amory does,” said Tom. “Infantry or aviation—aviation
 sounds like the romantic side of the war, of course—like cavalry
 used to be, you know; but like Amory I don’t know a horse-power
 from a piston-rod.”
 
 Somehow Amory’s dissatisfaction with his lack of enthusiasm
 culminated in an attempt to put the blame for the whole war on
 the ancestors of his generation... all the people who cheered for
 Germany in 1870.... All the materialists rampant, all the
 idolizers of German science and efficiency. So he sat one day in
 an English lecture and heard “Locksley Hall” quoted and fell into
 a brown study with contempt for Tennyson and all he stood for—for
 he took him as a representative of the Victorians.
 
   Victorians, Victorians, who never learned to weep Who sowed the
   bitter harvest that your children go to reap—
 
 scribbled Amory in his note-book. The lecturer was saying
 something about Tennyson’s solidity and fifty heads were bent to
 take notes. Amory turned over to a fresh page and began scrawling
 again.
 
  “They shuddered when they found what Mr. Darwin was about, They
  shuddered when the waltz came in and Newman hurried out—”
 
 But the waltz came in much earlier; he crossed that out.
 
 “And entitled A Song in the Time of Order,” came the professor’s
 voice, droning far away. “Time of Order”—Good Lord! Everything
 crammed in the box and the Victorians sitting on the lid smiling
 serenely.... With Browning in his Italian villa crying bravely:
 “All’s for the best.” Amory scribbled again.
 
  “You knelt up in the temple and he bent to hear you pray, You thanked
  him for your ‘glorious gains’—reproached him for ‘Cathay.’”
 
 Why could he never get more than a couplet at a time? Now he
 needed something to rhyme with:
 
  “You would keep Him straight with science, tho He had gone wrong
  before...”
 
 Well, anyway....
 
  “You met your children in your home—‘I’ve fixed it up!’ you cried,
  Took your fifty years of Europe, and then virtuously—died.”
 
 “That was to a great extent Tennyson’s idea,” came the lecturer’s
 voice. “Swinburne’s Song in the Time of Order might well have
 been Tennyson’s title. He idealized order against chaos, against
 waste.”
 
 At last Amory had it. He turned over another page and scrawled
 vigorously for the twenty minutes that was left of the hour. Then
 he walked up to the desk and deposited a page torn out of his
 note-book.
 
 “Here’s a poem to the Victorians, sir,” he said coldly.
 
 The professor picked it up curiously while Amory backed rapidly
 through the door.
 
 Here is what he had written:
 
    “Songs in the time of order You left for us to sing, Proofs with
    excluded middles, Answers to life in rhyme, Keys of the prison
    warder And ancient bells to ring, Time was the end of riddles, We
    were the end of time...
     Here were domestic oceans And a sky that we might reach, Guns and a
     guarded border, Gantlets—but not to fling, Thousands of old
     emotions And a platitude for each, Songs in the time of order— And
     tongues, that we might sing.”
 
 
 THE END OF MANY THINGS
 
 Early April slipped by in a haze—a haze of long evenings on the
 club veranda with the graphophone playing “Poor Butterfly”
 inside... for “Poor Butterfly” had been the song of that last
 year. The war seemed scarcely to touch them and it might have
 been one of the senior springs of the past, except for the
 drilling every other afternoon, yet Amory realized poignantly
 that this was the last spring under the old regime.
 
 “This is the great protest against the superman,” said Amory.
 
 “I suppose so,” Alec agreed.
 
 “He’s absolutely irreconcilable with any Utopia. As long as he
 occurs, there’s trouble and all the latent evil that makes a
 crowd list and sway when he talks.”
 
 “And of course, all that he is is a gifted man without a moral
 sense.”
 
 “That’s all. I think the worst thing to contemplate is this—it’s
 all happened before, how soon will it happen again? Fifty years
 after Waterloo Napoleon was as much a hero to English school
 children as Wellington. How do we know our grandchildren won’t
 idolize Von Hindenburg the same way?”
 
 “What brings it about?”
 
 “Time, damn it, and the historian. If we could only learn to look
 on evil as evil, whether it’s clothed in filth or monotony or
 magnificence.”
 
 “God! Haven’t we raked the universe over the coals for four
 years?”
 
 Then the night came that was to be the last. Tom and Amory, bound
 in the morning for different training-camps, paced the shadowy
 walks as usual and seemed still to see around them the faces of
 the men they knew.
 
 “The grass is full of ghosts to-night.”
 
 “The whole campus is alive with them.”
 
 They paused by Little and watched the moon rise, to make silver
 of the slate roof of Dodd and blue the rustling trees.
 
 “You know,” whispered Tom, “what we feel now is the sense of all
 the gorgeous youth that has rioted through here in two hundred
 years.”
 
 A last burst of singing flooded up from Blair Arch—broken voices
 for some long parting.
 
 “And what we leave here is more than this class; it’s the whole
 heritage of youth. We’re just one generation—we’re breaking all
 the links that seemed to bind us here to top-booted and
 high-stocked generations. We’ve walked arm and arm with Burr and
 Light-Horse Harry Lee through half these deep-blue nights.”
 
 “That’s what they are,” Tom tangented off, “deep blue—a bit of
 color would spoil them, make them exotic. Spires, against a sky
 that’s a promise of dawn, and blue light on the slate roofs—it
 hurts... rather—”
 
 “Good-by, Aaron Burr,” Amory called toward deserted Nassau Hall,
 “you and I knew strange corners of life.”
 
 His voice echoed in the stillness.
 
 “The torches are out,” whispered Tom. “Ah, Messalina, the long
 shadows are building minarets on the stadium—”
 
 For an instant the voices of freshman year surged around them and
 then they looked at each other with faint tears in their eyes.
 
 “Damn!”
 
 “Damn!”
 
 The last light fades and drifts across the land—the low, long
 land, the sunny land of spires; the ghosts of evening tune again
 their lyres and wander singing in a plaintive band down the long
 corridors of trees; pale fires echo the night from tower top to
 tower: Oh, sleep that dreams, and dream that never tires, press
 from the petals of the lotus flower something of this to keep,
 the essence of an hour.
 
 No more to wait the twilight of the moon in this sequestered vale
 of star and spire, for one eternal morning of desire passes to
 time and earthy afternoon. Here, Heraclitus, did you find in fire
 and shifting things the prophecy you hurled down the dead years;
 this midnight my desire will see, shadowed among the embers,
 furled in flame, the splendor and the sadness of the world.
 
 INTERLUDE
 
 May, 1917-February, 1919
 
 A letter dated January, 1918, written by Monsignor Darcy to
 Amory, who is a second lieutenant in the 171st Infantry, Port of
 Embarkation, Camp Mills, Long Island.
 
 MY DEAR BOY:
 
 All you need tell me of yourself is that you still are; for the
 rest I merely search back in a restive memory, a thermometer that
 records only fevers, and match you with what I was at your age.
 But men will chatter and you and I will still shout our
 futilities to each other across the stage until the last silly
 curtain falls _plump!_ upon our bobbing heads. But you are
 starting the spluttering magic-lantern show of life with much the
 same array of slides as I had, so I need to write you if only to
 shriek the colossal stupidity of people....
 
 This is the end of one thing: for better or worse you will never
 again be quite the Amory Blaine that I knew, never again will we
 meet as we have met, because your generation is growing hard,
 much harder than mine ever grew, nourished as they were on the
 stuff of the nineties.
 
 Amory, lately I reread Aeschylus and there in the divine irony of
 the “Agamemnon” I find the only answer to this bitter age—all the
 world tumbled about our ears, and the closest parallel ages back
 in that hopeless resignation. There are times when I think of the
 men out there as Roman legionaries, miles from their corrupt
 city, stemming back the hordes... hordes a little more menacing,
 after all, than the corrupt city... another blind blow at the
 race, furies that we passed with ovations years ago, over whose
 corpses we bleated triumphantly all through the Victorian era....
 
 And afterward an out-and-out materialistic world—and the Catholic
 Church. I wonder where you’ll fit in. Of one thing I’m
 sure—Celtic you’ll live and Celtic you’ll die; so if you don’t
 use heaven as a continual referendum for your ideas you’ll find
 earth a continual recall to your ambitions.
 
 Amory, I’ve discovered suddenly that I’m an old man. Like all old
 men, I’ve had dreams sometimes and I’m going to tell you of them.
 I’ve enjoyed imagining that you were my son, that perhaps when I
 was young I went into a state of coma and begat you, and when I
 came to, had no recollection of it... it’s the paternal instinct,
 Amory—celibacy goes deeper than the flesh....
 
 Sometimes I think that the explanation of our deep resemblance is
 some common ancestor, and I find that the only blood that the
 Darcys and the O’Haras have in common is that of the
 O’Donahues... Stephen was his name, I think....
 
 When the lightning strikes one of us it strikes both: you had
 hardly arrived at the port of embarkation when I got my papers to
 start for Rome, and I am waiting every moment to be told where to
 take ship. Even before you get this letter I shall be on the
 ocean; then will come your turn. You went to war as a gentleman
 should, just as you went to school and college, because it was
 the thing to do. It’s better to leave the blustering and
 tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better.
 
 Do you remember that week-end last March when you brought Burne
 Holiday from Princeton to see me? What a magnificent boy he is!
 It gave me a frightful shock afterward when you wrote that he
 thought me splendid; how could he be so deceived? Splendid is the
 one thing that neither you nor I are. We are many other
 things—we’re extraordinary, we’re clever, we could be said, I
 suppose, to be brilliant. We can attract people, we can make
 atmosphere, we can almost lose our Celtic souls in Celtic
 subtleties, we can almost always have our own way; but
 splendid—rather not!
 
 I am going to Rome with a wonderful dossier and letters of
 introduction that cover every capital in Europe, and there will
 be “no small stir” when I get there. How I wish you were with me!
 This sounds like a rather cynical paragraph, not at all the sort
 of thing that a middle-aged clergyman should write to a youth
 about to depart for the war; the only excuse is that the
 middle-aged clergyman is talking to himself. There are deep
 things in us and you know what they are as well as I do. We have
 great faith, though yours at present is uncrystallized; we have a
 terrible honesty that all our sophistry cannot destroy and, above
 all, a childlike simplicity that keeps us from ever being really
 malicious.
 
 I have written a keen for you which follows. I am sorry your
 cheeks are not up to the description I have written of them, but
 you _will_ smoke and read all night—
 
 At any rate here it is:
 
 A Lament for a Foster Son, and He going to the War Against the
 King of Foreign.
 
  “Ochone He is gone from me the son of my mind And he in his golden
  youth like Angus Oge Angus of the bright birds And his mind strong and
  subtle like the mind of Cuchulin on Muirtheme.
   Awirra sthrue His brow is as white as the milk of the cows of Maeve
   And his cheeks like the cherries of the tree And it bending down to
   Mary and she feeding the Son of God.
   Aveelia Vrone His hair is like the golden collar of the Kings at Tara
   And his eyes like the four gray seas of Erin. And they swept with the
   mists of rain.
   Mavrone go Gudyo He to be in the joyful and red battle Amongst the
   chieftains and they doing great deeds of valor His life to go from
   him It is the chords of my own soul would be loosed.
   A Vich Deelish My heart is in the heart of my son And my life is in
   his life surely A man can be twice young In the life of his sons
   only.
   Jia du Vaha Alanav May the Son of God be above him and beneath him,
   before him and behind him May the King of the elements cast a mist
   over the eyes of the King of Foreign, May the Queen of the Graces
   lead him by the hand the way he can go through the midst of his
   enemies and they not seeing him
   May Patrick of the Gael and Collumb of the Churches and the five
   thousand Saints of Erin be better than a shield to him And he got
   into the fight. Och Ochone.”
 
 Amory—Amory—I feel, somehow, that this is all; one or both of us
 is not going to last out this war.... I’ve been trying to tell
 you how much this reincarnation of myself in you has meant in the
 last few years... curiously alike we are... curiously unlike.
 Good-by, dear boy, and God be with you. THAYER DARCY.
 
 
 EMBARKING AT NIGHT
 
 Amory moved forward on the deck until he found a stool under an
 electric light. He searched in his pocket for note-book and
 pencil and then began to write, slowly, laboriously:
 
  “We leave to-night... Silent, we filled the still, deserted street, A
  column of dim gray, And ghosts rose startled at the muffled beat Along
  the moonless way; The shadowy shipyards echoed to the feet That turned
  from night and day.
     And so we linger on the windless decks, See on the spectre shore
     Shades of a thousand days, poor gray-ribbed wrecks... Oh, shall we
     then deplore Those futile years! See how the sea is white! The
     clouds have broken and the heavens burn To hollow highways, paved
     with gravelled light The churning of the waves about the stern
     Rises to one voluminous nocturne, ... We leave to-night.”
 
 A letter from Amory, headed “Brest, March 11th, 1919,” to
 Lieutenant T. P. D’Invilliers, Camp Gordon, Ga.
 
 DEAR BAUDELAIRE:—
 
 We meet in Manhattan on the 30th of this very mo.; we then
 proceed to take a very sporty apartment, you and I and Alec, who
 is at me elbow as I write. I don’t know what I’m going to do but
 I have a vague dream of going into politics. Why is it that the
 pick of the young Englishmen from Oxford and Cambridge go into
 politics and in the U. S. A. we leave it to the muckers?—raised
 in the ward, educated in the assembly and sent to Congress,
 fat-paunched bundles of corruption, devoid of “both ideas and
 ideals” as the debaters used to say. Even forty years ago we had
 good men in politics, but we, we are brought up to pile up a
 million and “show what we are made of.” Sometimes I wish I’d been
 an Englishman; American life is so damned dumb and stupid and
 healthy.
 
 Since poor Beatrice died I’ll probably have a little money, but
 very darn little. I can forgive mother almost everything except
 the fact that in a sudden burst of religiosity toward the end,
 she left half of what remained to be spent in stained-glass
 windows and seminary endowments. Mr. Barton, my lawyer, writes me
 that my thousands are mostly in street railways and that the said
 Street R.R. s are losing money because of the five-cent fares.
 Imagine a salary list that gives $350 a month to a man that can’t
 read and write!—yet I believe in it, even though I’ve seen what
 was once a sizable fortune melt away between speculation,
 extravagance, the democratic administration, and the income
 tax—modern, that’s me all over, Mabel.
 
 At any rate we’ll have really knock-out rooms—you can get a job
 on some fashion magazine, and Alec can go into the Zinc Company
 or whatever it is that his people own—he’s looking over my
 shoulder and he says it’s a brass company, but I don’t think it
 matters much, do you? There’s probably as much corruption in
 zinc-made money as brass-made money. As for the well-known Amory,
 he would write immortal literature if he were sure enough about
 anything to risk telling any one else about it. There is no more
 dangerous gift to posterity than a few cleverly turned
 platitudes.
 
 Tom, why don’t you become a Catholic? Of course to be a good one
 you’d have to give up those violent intrigues you used to tell me
 about, but you’d write better poetry if you were linked up to
 tall golden candlesticks and long, even chants, and even if the
 American priests are rather burgeois, as Beatrice used to say,
 still you need only go to the sporty churches, and I’ll introduce
 you to Monsignor Darcy who really is a wonder.
 
 Kerry’s death was a blow, so was Jesse’s to a certain extent. And
 I have a great curiosity to know what queer corner of the world
 has swallowed Burne. Do you suppose he’s in prison under some
 false name? I confess that the war instead of making me orthodox,
 which is the correct reaction, has made me a passionate agnostic.
 The Catholic Church has had its wings clipped so often lately
 that its part was timidly negligible, and they haven’t any good
 writers any more. I’m sick of Chesterton.
 
 I’ve only discovered one soldier who passed through the
 much-advertised spiritual crisis, like this fellow, Donald
 Hankey, and the one I knew was already studying for the ministry,
 so he was ripe for it. I honestly think that’s all pretty much
 rot, though it seemed to give sentimental comfort to those at
 home; and may make fathers and mothers appreciate their children.
 This crisis-inspired religion is rather valueless and fleeting at
 best. I think four men have discovered Paris to one that
 discovered God.
 
 But us—you and me and Alec—oh, we’ll get a Jap butler and dress
 for dinner and have wine on the table and lead a contemplative,
 emotionless life until we decide to use machine-guns with the
 property owners—or throw bombs with the Bolshevik God! Tom, I
 hope something happens. I’m restless as the devil and have a
 horror of getting fat or falling in love and growing domestic.
 
 The place at Lake Geneva is now for rent but when I land I’m
 going West to see Mr. Barton and get some details. Write me care
 of the Blackstone, Chicago.
 
   S’ever, dear Boswell,
     SAMUEL JOHNSON.
